1	51A	Alzheimer's disease	regulation	51A expression drives a splicing shift of SORL1 from the synthesis of the canonical long protein variant 1 to an alternatively spliced protein form. This process, resulting in a decreased synthesis of SORL1 variant 1, is associated with an impaired processing of APP, leading to increase of AÎ² formation. 	chr19	58770915	58770934	-	Human	51A	NC_012749.1	22996644
2	7SK	AIDS	Expression	Stable expression of cdNIPP1 increased CDK9 phosphorylation on Thr(186) and the association of CDK9 with 7SK RNA. The stable expression of cdNIPP1 disrupted the interaction of Tat and PP1 and inhibited HIV-1 transcription. Expression of cdNIPP1 as a part of the HIV-1 genome inhibited HIV-1 replication.	chr6	52860418	52860749	+	Human	RN7SK; 7SK	NR_001445.2	21098020

4	7SK	AIDS	Interaction	Tat efficiently replaces HEXIM1 on the 7SK snRNA in vivo and therefore, it promotes the disassembly of the 7SK/HEXIM/P-TEFb negative transcriptional regulatory snRNP to augment the nuclear level of active P-TEFb.  The human 7SK snRNA carries a TAR RNA-like Tat-binding element that is essential for the normal transcriptional regulatory function of 7SK questions the viability of HIV therapeutic approaches based on small drugs blocking the Tat-binding site of HIV TAR.	chr6	52860418	52860749	+	Human	RN7SK; 7SK	NR_001445.2	20976203

In Trim24-knockout hepatocytes, VL30 derepression leads to accumulation of reverse-transcribed VL30 cDNA in the cytoplasm that correlates with activation of the viral-defense interferon responses mimicking the preneoplastic inflammatory state seen in human liver following exogenous viral infection. Furthermore, upon derepression, VL30 long terminal repeats (LTRs) act as promoter and enhancer elements deregulating expression of neighboring genes and generating enhancer RNAs that are required for LTR enhancer activity in hepatocytes in vivo.
