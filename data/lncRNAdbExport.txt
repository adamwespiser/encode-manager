21A	ncRNA 21A	Characteristics	~300 nucleotide, nonpolyadenylated, RNAP III transcript. . SINE (short interspersed nucleotide element - AluJb). 21A lacks the Alu-specific intragenic consensus elements needed to promote its pol III transcription such as the blocks A and B, which points to transcription driven by an extragenic type 3 pol III promoter.. Very low free energy (deltaG) value (deltaG < -100) indicating strong secondary structure.
21A	ncRNA 21A	Expression	Nuclear localisation. Detected in tested cultured cells such as HeLa and skin fibroblast cells.. The level of 21A transcription was very low in three immortalized, fully proliferating cell lines (HeLa, 293T, and LAN5) compared to unproliferating/resting PBL (peripheral blood lymphocyte) cells. Similarly, the 21A RNA level in primary skin fibroblasts was higher than in 293T cells, reinforcing an inverse correlation between endogenous 21A expression and cell proliferation. 
21A	ncRNA 21A	Function	21AS is one of a number of RNAP III-transcribed short ncRNAs that have sequence complementarity to protein-coding genes, possibly acting as as a natural trans-chromosomal antisense RNA. Aligned to the human genome, it shows several homology hits, among which the most highly significant were associated to multiple intronic regions of centromeric protein F gene (CENP-F). In vitro over-expression of 21AS transcripts inhibits CENP-F protein accumulation and decreased levels of CENP-F mRNA, indicating that 21AS regulates CENP-F expression in trans.. 21A RNAs has a role in the control of the proliferation of human tumor cell lines, possibly via regulation of CENP-F expression. This effect was not observed in a mouse cell line.
21A	ncRNA 21A	Conservation	Similarly to all of the 7SL/Alu-derived elements, 21A is primate-specific.
7SK	7-3 RNA, K-RNA, 7SK-RNA, 7SK snRNA, RN7SK	Characteristics	~330 nt in vertebrates*. Transcribed by RNAP III, GC-rich sequence forming conserved secondary structures  (especially 3' and 5' stem-loop motifs).. 7SK RNA is capped at its 5' end by BCDIN3, a specific methylase methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE) (Jeronimo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643375). . RNAP II was recently found to bind near 7SK promoter, as well as many other known Pol III genes, suggesting that RNAP II may also play a role in regulating their transcription (Raha (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20139302).. *In invertebrates, 7SK homologs may have different sizes (such as >400 nt and ~130 nt in drosophilids and nematodes, respectively). (Gruber (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18566019) (Marz (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19734296)
7SK	7-3 RNA, K-RNA, 7SK-RNA, 7SK snRNA, RN7SK	Expression	Nuclear, highly abundant (one of the most abundant small RNAs in vertebrate cells), first isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts, but ubiquitously expressed.. RNA sequencing from 11 humans tissues confirmed ubiquitous high expression of 7SK with expression in some tissues being higher than any mRNA (Castle (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668672). 
7SK	7-3 RNA, K-RNA, 7SK-RNA, 7SK snRNA, RN7SK	Function	Controls RNAP II activity by inhibiting P-TEFb elongation factor, which is a cdk-cyclin kinase that functions as both a general and an HIV-1 Tat-specific transcription factor (Nguyen (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11713533) (Yang (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11713532), with an impact on cell growth and differentiation.. 7SK snRNA is a central scaffold that coordinates protein-protein interactions and, by inhibiting P-TEFb kinase-mediated CTD phosphorylation, regulates RNAP II elongation (Nguyen (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11713533). 7SK snRNP (composed of 7SK snRNA, Hexim1, Larp7/Pip7S, and the P-TEFb subunits CycT1 and Cdk9) is not only critical for controlling transcription, but also for regulating alternative splicing coupled to transcription elongation (Barboric (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416841). It is also essential for vertebrate development (Barboric (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416841). The 3' end of HIC mRNA has full activity and contains a predicted structure resembling the 3'-terminal hairpin of 7SK that is critical for P-TEFb binding (Barboric (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416841).. 7SK has been found highly enriched in isolated chromatin fractions, which may be related to its role in transcriptional regulation (Mondal (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20404130).. At an early stage of the HIV transcription cycle, elongation is prevented as P-TEFb is recruited to the HIV-1 promoter in a catalytically inactive state bound to the 7SK snRNP and also the Tat trans-activator of transcription protein. The inhibitory 7SK snRNP may be displaced by the nascent TAR HIV RNA that also binds Tat protein, activating P-TEFb kinase and transcriptional elongation (D'Orso (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562857). Displacement of 7SK may also be performed by cellular RNAs, as indicated by the 3'-untranslated region (~300-nt) of HIC mRNA, which forms complexes with P-TEFb and is necessary and sufficient for stimulation of P-TEFb-dependent transcription of the HIV promoter (Young (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17925858).. 7SK RNA also inhibits APOBEC3C deaminase activity and sequesters it to the nucleolus, suggesting broader role for 7SK RNA in regulating key nuclear functions (He (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17381310).
7SK	7-3 RNA, K-RNA, 7SK-RNA, 7SK snRNA, RN7SK	Conservation	Highly conserved throughout jawed vertebrates (but in lamprey it differs in 32% of its sequence from the mammalian 7SK (GÃ¼rsoy (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10824089)), and has a few conserved sequence and structure motifs over longer evolutionary distances. Homologs have been identified in deuterostome invertebrates and in two protostome phyla (mollusks and annelids) (Gruber (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18193315). More recently, it has also been detected in arthropods, showing that two highly structured conserved domains (5'- and 3'-stem regions) were present in the bilaterian ancestor (Gruber (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18566019), and even in nematode Caenorhabditis species (Marz (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19734296).
7SK	7-3 RNA, K-RNA, 7SK-RNA, 7SK snRNA, RN7SK	Misc	The 7SK family contains a number of pseudogenes and derived repeats.. May be implicated in the transformation-dependent activation of oncogenes SV40 T-antigen and c-myc gene promoters (Krause (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9018369).
7SK	7-3 RNA, K-RNA, 7SK-RNA, 7SK snRNA, RN7SK	Name	RN7SK: RNA, 7SK small nuclear
7SL	7S RNA, SRP RNA, 4.5S SRP RNA, 4.5S RNA, RN7SL1 RNA	Characteristics	~300 nt, transcribed by RNAPIII. . The eukaryotic small cytoplasmic 7SL is an RNA component of the SRP (signal recognition particle), which associates with the ribosome and targets nascent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion or membrane insertion (Walter (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6181418) (Zwieb (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15611297).
7SL	7S RNA, SRP RNA, 4.5S SRP RNA, 4.5S RNA, RN7SL1 RNA	Expression	Ubiquitously expressed at high levels. Localises to the cytoplasm. An expression profile from 11 human tissues using RNA sequencing showed 7SL was most highly expressed ncRNA and could be an order of magnitude more highly expressed than any mRNA (Castle (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668672). 
7SL	7S RNA, SRP RNA, 4.5S SRP RNA, 4.5S RNA, RN7SL1 RNA	Function	7SL RNA is required for structural and functional properties of SRP (Walter (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6181418), being a scaffold component upon which the six proteins of the SRP bind in higher eukaryotes. In mammals SRP consists of the SRP RNA the six proteins named SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP54, SRP68, and SRP72 (Walter (1983) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6196367).. Bacterial SRP has a much reduced complexity, consisting of a small SRP RNA (4.5S RNA) and a homolog of protein SRP54, also called Ffh or P48 (Bernstein (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8389475). In archaea only two SRP proteins, SRP19 and SRP54, are thought to be part of the SRP, although SRP RNA closely resembles the mammalian homolog (Bhuiyan (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10684931).. There is evidence that a highly conserved region of 7SL RNA catalyses the binding of SRP to its receptor SR, and that this RNA stimulates the GTPase activities of the SRP-SR complex (Zhang (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18617187) (Siu (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17164479) (Peluso (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10834842).
7SL	7S RNA, SRP RNA, 4.5S SRP RNA, 4.5S RNA, RN7SL1 RNA	Conservation	May have originated from the bacterial SRP (GTP-regulated ribonucleoprotein that targets secretory or membrane proteins during translation), it is ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells and several viruses (Li (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6802847). The secondary structure of 7SL RNA is conserved from prokaryotes to distant eukaryotic species (Labuda (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7528809).
7SL	7S RNA, SRP RNA, 4.5S SRP RNA, 4.5S RNA, RN7SL1 RNA	Misc	7SL is the RNA ancestor of Alu transposon sequences, which emerged ~ 55 million years ago, are present specifically in primates and comprise ~10% of the human genome. Rodent B1 elements, as well as  4.5S and primate BC200 RNAs are also related to the terminal portions of 7SL RNA sequence (Labuda (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7528809) (Quentin (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7529207).

Adapt33	5430416N02Rik (probable mouse homologue), linc1354	Name	"adaptive response 33"
Adapt33	5430416N02Rik (probable mouse homologue), linc1354	Characteristics	1.46 and 0.99kb bands detected by Northern blot (Wang (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806733).. Mouse 5430416N02Rik has 0.6 and 3.5 kb isoforms.
Adapt33	5430416N02Rik (probable mouse homologue), linc1354	Expression	Isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cell-derived HA-1 fibroblasts (Wang (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806733).. Multiple stress-responsive gene. Hydrogen peroxide-inducible. Induction appears to be dependent on calcium, occurred as early as 90 min, and was maximal at 5h. Adapt33 induction by hydrogen peroxide is suggested to occur at the mRNA stability level, and stability analysis indicated a short half-life. (Wang (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12837039, Wang (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806733). Cell fractionation revealed that a significant proportion of adapt33 RNA is associated with active translation in the polysomes. (Wang (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806733). Analysis of expression following the stimulation of apoptosis with hydrogen peroxide and staurosporine indicated a strong correlation with the apoptosis response. (Wang (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12837039). In mouse probable homologue expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018).. Mouse RNA found to be highly unstable with a half-life <2 hr in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755). 
Adapt33	5430416N02Rik (probable mouse homologue), linc1354	Function	Mouse RNA was found to interact with a number of chromatin binding protein/complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells including PRC1, PRC2, JARID1B, ESET, SUV39H1, SETD8 and	CBX1 with the general pattern being interaction with repressors of gene expression (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018).
Adapt33	5430416N02Rik (probable mouse homologue), linc1354	Conservation	Adapt33 sequence has homology to mouse AK017316.
Adapt33	5430416N02Rik (probable mouse homologue), linc1354	Misc	Adapt33 promoter constructs have strong activity in both hamster and human cells. (Wang (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12837039)
Air	Airn, IGF2RAS	Names	Antisense Igf2r RNA
Air	Airn, IGF2RAS	Characteristics	108 kb (unspliced). Transcribed from an antisense promoter located in intron 2 of the Igf2r (insulin-like growth-factor type-2 receptor) gene (Lyle (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10802648, Wutz (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9338788). . Also a number of spliced isoforms from 500bp to ~1.4kb (Seidl (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16874305).. Imprinted, expressed only from paternal allele (Wutz (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9338788, Lyle (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10802648).
Air	Airn, IGF2RAS	Function	Regulates genomic imprinting of a cluster of autosomal genes (Igf2r, Slc22a2 and Slc22a3) in cis, on mouse chromosome 17 (Sleutels (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11845212).  . Truncation of Air disrupts imprinting not only of Igf2r but also the nearby non-overlapping genes Slc22a2 and Slc22a3, leading to mice with a lower birth weight (Sleutels (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11845212).. Air RNA forms a "cloud" over the imprinted DNA locus, binding to chromatin. Recruits G9a histone methyltransferase to epigenetically silence Slc22a3 (Nagano (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18988810). Igf2r is not silenced by this mechanism.. Nb: Slc22a3 and Slc22a2 are only imprinted at a specific time point in placental development. Outside of this time point the Air "cloud"/ Air chromatin binding and repressive histone modification are not found on these gene loci (Nagano (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18988810). 
Air	Airn, IGF2RAS	Expression	Expressed during embryonic development, in the placenta (Wutz (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9338788, Lyle (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10802648), adult brain, lung and heart (Seidl (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16874305).. Expressed in glial cells of the developing brain but not in neurons, explains lack of Igf2r imprinting in these neurons. (Yamasaki (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16037066). Unspliced Air is unstable, localised to the nucleus. Spliced isoforms, found in nucleus and cytoplasm, are more stable (Seidl (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16874305).
Air	Airn, IGF2RAS	Conservation	All characterisation been carried out in mouse. Recently Air has been identified in human (Yotova (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18789384) but full length transcripts have yet to be characterised.
Air	Airn, IGF2RAS	Misc	Nb: Genebank and NCBI Gene sequences for Air are all for the spliced mouse isoforms. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/104103. UCSC browser link below is for transcript variant 3 which covers a similar length to the unspliced transcript.
AK023948	None known	Features	AK023948 is embedded in the TG-SLA (thyroglobulin and Src-like adaptor) locus on chromosome 8q24, a susceptibility locus for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). An unspliced cDNA, AK023948 is located in an intron of both the TG (sense orientation) and SLA (antisense) genes.. A 12 Kb haplotype containing 8 SNP markers for PTC is harboured in the TG-SLA locus, which also includes two additional putative noncoding RNA genes.. AK023948 (cDNA FLJ13886 fis, clone THYRO1001559) was cloned from thyroid gland and is 2,807b long (Ota (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14702039). The transcript is significantly down-regulated in most PTC tumors, thus representing a candidate susceptibility gene for PTC.
AK082072	linc-POLR3G-8	Characteristics	Intergenic, 2 exon transcript in mouse, with HeK4me3 chromtain mark at 5' (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).. Human ortholog is linc-POLR3G-8 (Cabili (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21890647). Human ortholog has a number of splice isoforms with 3 or more exons.
AK082072	linc-POLR3G-8	Expression	Expressed in specific regions of embryonic and post-natal mouse brain (see Chodroff for details) including the rostal migratory stream at P3 with a âpotential association with inhibitory GABAergic neuronsâ (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).. Expressed in opossum and chicken embryonic brains showing spatio-temporal conservation of expression (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).
AK082072	linc-POLR3G-8	Conservation	Highly conserved for a lincRNA 36.7% mouse transcript overlaps phastCons elements (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).. Conserved in mammals and back to frog, although mouse exon 2 is not conserved in all orthologs (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).. Opossum ortholog [GenBank:GU951678]. Frog and chicken ([GenBank: CX847574.1 and CR35248.1] respectively (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).
AK082072	linc-POLR3G-8	Misc	Mouse transcript contains Evofold-predicted RNA secondary structure (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).. LncRNA transcripts in human from bidirectional promoter with TMEM161B (over 50kb upstream from linc-POLR3G-8 start site) can also share exons 2 and/or 3. See BC047059 - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BC047059.
Alpha 250/ Alpha 280	None known	Characteristics	Two overlapping antisense RNAs from intron 1 of the human ribosomal protein 14 (Rps14) gene, identified by RNase Protection Assay (RPA).. RPA expression analysis using both cell extracts and cell-free transcription system indicates full-length sizes of 250 and 280 nt, respectively. Transcripts terminate at the same nucleotide, therefore alpha-250 overlaps alpha-280 along its whole length.. Transcription of both RNAs is resistant to high concentrations of RNAPII inhibitor alpha-amanitin.
Alpha 250/ Alpha 280	None known	Expression	Ubiquitously expressed in the human tissues and cell lines examined. .  Alpha-250 was almost exclusively cytoplasmic. Alpha- 280 was mostly in the nucleus.
Alpha 250/ Alpha 280	None known	Function	Regulates RPS14 transcription.. Each lncRNA can interact with the Rps14 gene loci to stimulate its expression in-trans.. Each lncRNA is transcribed through a known enhancer with putative transcription factor binding abilities, suggesting the 'enhancer' may be the transcribed RNA, which could be recruiting transcription factors to the Rps14 gene. 
AncR-1	None known	Characteristics	Several splice isoforms. Main isoform is a 6-7kb transcript.
AncR-1	None known	Expression	Expressed in brain cortex (not ubiquitously expressed). Also differentially expressed between queens, drones and workers: detected in sex organs in queens and drones and in the hypopharyngeal glands and oenocytes of worker bees.. Localises to punctate foci in nucleus. Did not co-localise with the Ks-1 nuclear lncRNA.
AncR-1	None known	Conservation	Also present in another honey bee species: Apis cerana. Sequence was highly conserved but putative ORFs were not.. At time of study, AncR-1 sequence did not show homology to sequences from any other organisms
AncR-1	None known	Name	Apis noncoding RNA-1
AncR-1	None known	Misc	Nucleotide accessions of different isoforms: AB125322.1, AB125323.1, AB125324.1
ANRIL	CDKN2B-AS1, p15AS	Name	ANRIL: Antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus;. CDKN2B-AS1: CDKN2B antisense RNA 1;. P15AS: P15 antisense RNA
ANRIL	CDKN2B-AS1, p15AS	Characteristics	Present in multiple splicing isoforms (Folkersen (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19888323) (such as the CDK2BAS RefSeq sequence NR_003529.3 of ~3.9kb). Also detected as an unspliced transcript of 34.8 kb (Yu (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18185590), specified as p15AS, but which seems to correspond to an isoform with the first intron of CDK2BAS retained. Antisense to the tumor suppressor gene p15/CDKN2A. (Yu (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18185590). Traverses a noncoding region centromeric to CDKN2A, a region containing the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus and implicated in a range of complex diseases including cancer (such as melanoma-neural system tumor syndrome), type 2 diabetes, periodontitis and coronary heart disease (see extensive reference list in Literature below, and Popov (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20716961 for a review).. Transcript found to be quite unstable with a half-life >4 hr in human Hela cells (Tani (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369889).
ANRIL	CDKN2B-AS1, p15AS	Expression	Expressed in tissues and cell types affected by atherosclerosis. Increased levels of ANRIL are found in patients carrying the atherosclerosis risk haplotype expression, including in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whole blood and atherosclerotic plaque tissue, and the levels were directly correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis (Holdt (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20056914). . Up-regulated in prostate cancer (Yap (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20541999).
ANRIL	CDKN2B-AS1, p15AS	Function	In vitro over-expression of p15as/ANRIL RNA was originally demonstrated to induce epigenetic silencing of p15 gene expression (Yu (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18185590).. Recently, ANRIL RNA was found to interact and regulate chromobox 7 (CBX7), a component of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1), which methylates histone H3 lysine 27 to promote epigenetic silencing, and is also up-regulated in prostate cancer. Interaction occurs with a conserved chromodomain of CBX7 and is essential for the ability of PRC1 to repress the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus and control cell senescence. (Yap (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20541999)
anti-NOS2A	None known	Characteristics	RNA estimated at ~1.9kb. anti-NOS2A has homology to the NOS2A protein coding gene (NOS2: Nitric oxide synthase 2 enzyme), only a small part ~100-nt is antisense to NOS2A. Homology stretches from intron14/exon15 to exon19/intron19. Formed by partial duplication of NOS2A followed by an inversion of part of the duplicated sequence to form a ~4kb locus in human.. PolyA- RNA. Intronless (NOS2A introns now part of the anti-NOS2A exon).. Expressed from a hypothesized internal promoter.
anti-NOS2A	None known	Expression	Expressed in brain cancer. . Expressed in hESCs (at a higher level than NOS2A) but down-regulated ~7 fold in neurospheres, while NOS2A showed a reciprocal expression pattern.
anti-NOS2A	None known	Function	Reciprocal regulation with NOS2A could suggest a regulatory role for the antisense transcript but this has yet to be tested.
anti-NOS2A	None known	Conservation	Found in primates but not in rodents.
anti-NOS2A	None known	Misc	Nb: Precise genomic location and sequence of anti-NOS2A was not provided by Korneev et al.. Anti-NOS2A was identified as belonging to contig AC053481 and homologous sequence within this contig (including evidence of an invesrsion) can be found at ~chr17:57,692,139-57,696,081 in HG18, but this does not exactly define the transcript identified by Korneev et al.
antiPeg11	antiRtl1, PEG11as	Characteristics	Antisense transcript to Peg11/Rtl1. Peg11 is a retrotransposon-like protein coding gene (Charlier (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11337479, Byrne (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20072617).. Reciprocal imprinting: antiPeg11 maternally expressed whereas Rtl1/Peg11 is paternally expressed. (Charlier (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11337479, Seitz (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796779, Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).. antiPeg11 contains 5 maternally expressed miRNAs (4 found in mammals, 1 specific to rodents, 1 specific to non-rodents) (Seitz (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796779,	Davis (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15854907).. In humans these are mir-431, mir-433, mir-127, mir-432 and mir-136. 
antiPeg11	antiRtl1, PEG11as	Expression	Peg11 is expressed in a number of tissues in mouse, while antiPeg11 expression is restricted mostly to embryos and adult brain. In brain it was expressed at a higher level than Peg11 (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).. antiPeg11 miRNAs have a similar expression profile to the full length transcript (Davis (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15854907).. High expression of antiRtl1 in sheep skeletal muscle (Charlier (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11337479).. Full length, unspliced, unprocessed, transcript was around ~5kb, with smaller (likely processed) species also present (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).
antiPeg11	antiRtl1, PEG11as	Function	antiPeg11 binds the PRC2 chromatin modification complex (Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659).. antiPeg11 miRNAs target Rtl1 (Davis (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15854907).
antiPeg11	antiRtl1, PEG11as	Conservation	Eutherian mammals (Davis (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15854907, Edwards (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18532878).. Suggested that anti-rtl1 has evolved as part of the parental conflict hypothesis where the maternally expressed antisense gene inhibits the paternally expressed (fetal growth promoting) gene (Davis (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15854907).
antiPeg11	antiRtl1, PEG11as	Misc	No full length antiPeg11 cDNAs have been cloned but there is a partial clone from mouse EU434921.1 which is given in the UCSC browser link below. This sequence "Begins at the end of miR-431 precursor and ends at the beginning of miR-127 precursor" (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).. Like in mouse the exact nature of the transcript in other mammals is not known, human browser link below is to sequence defined by the microRNAs contained within antiPeg11, others are to Peg11.
antisense TGF beta 3	None known	Characteristics	~4.5kb antisense TGF beta 3 RNA
antisense TGF beta 3	None known	Expression	Expressed during heart development.. Showed slightly higher expression in AV, when epithelial to mesenchymal transformation is initiated compared to the quiesent cells in the ventricle. By contrast TGF beta3 PTC was ~5x more highly expressed.. Antisense transcript showed increasing expression over timepoints that correlated with the loss of ability for AV cells to undergo transformation, whereas TGF beta3 PTC peaked and declined during the transformation window.
antisense TGF beta 3	None known	Misc	Heart valve formation during heart development requires an epithelial to mesenchymal transformation of cells in the atrioventricular (AV) canal.. Sequence and precise genome location of the transcript has not been defined.
At4	TPSI family 	Characteristics	At4: member of a family of RNAs induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation in plants that have a region of complementarity to miR-399 and short non-conserved ORFs (Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366, Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506, Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101).. Other family members in Arabidopsis are At4-1, At4-2, At4-3 and IPS1 - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Detail.aspx?TKeyid=158 (Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506, Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101).. At4 is ~750nuc (Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366).
At4	TPSI family 	Expression	Expression of At4 family members is induced upon Pi starvation (Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366, Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101).. At4 is expressed in roots (Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366) and shoots (MartÃ­n (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11123795).. Hormonal signaling by cytokinins and abscisic acid repressed At4 expression in the roots (MartÃ­n (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11123795, Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506).
At4	TPSI family 	Function	Loss of At4 lead to increased shoot Pi content and an increase in the shoot:root Pi ratio under low Pi conditions suggesting At4 affects Pi distribution and plant growth (Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506).. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). At4 has complementarity to miR-399, but contains a central mismatch loop. Over-expression of At4 lead to a decrease in shoot Pi content suggesting that, like IPS1, At4 inhibits miR-399 through target mimicry thereby allowing activity of PHO2 (Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101).. At4 and IPS1 appear to be functionally redundant as overexpression of one gave same phenotypic change as overexpression of both (Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101).
At4	TPSI family 	Conservation	At4 and IPS1 are paralogs in Arabidopsis.. At4 only shares homology with other family members (ie: At4-1 and At4-2, Mt4 in Medicago truncatula and Mt4-like in Glycine max) in the miR-399 complementarity region (Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366, Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506).
At4	TPSI family 	Misc	Accession for other family members:. At4-1: AY536062; At4-2: AY334555; At4-3: AI995459
B2 SINE RNA	None known	Characteristics	Short interspersed element (SINE) repeat present in more than 10^5 copies in the mouse genome (Kramerov (1979) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/370792). Repeat is ~180nuc long (Krayev (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6296779) but expressed B2 RNAs vary from ~0.2-0.6kb (Kramerov (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6130513,Fornace (1986) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2426659). . The 5' of B2 SINE is derived from a tRNA (Lawrence (1985) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3839306, Daniels (1985) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3851163) while the 3' contains an A rich sequence (Krayev (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6296779).. Transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Krayev (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6296779, Singh (1985) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2581137).
B2 SINE RNA	None known	Expression	Expression highly induced upon viral infection (Singh (1985) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2581137), heat shock (Fornace (1986) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2426659) and differentially regulated during development (Bachvarova (1988) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2461884).. Also shows higher expression in some tumour cells (Kramerov (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6130513).. Found in the nucleus (Espinoza (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15300239) and the cytoplasm (Kramerov (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6130513).
B2 SINE RNA	None known	Function	B2 SINE RNA is a specific inhibitor of RNA polymerase II (Allen (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15300240).. During heat shock B2 RNA associated with RNA polymerase II and repressed its action. Nb: Only saw association of B2 RNA with RNA polymerase II after heat shock. (Allen (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15300240).. Represses transcription by stably binding an RNA docking site on the core polymerase II complex and blocking activity of the RNA polymerase preinitiation complex (Espinoza (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15300239). To achieve this B2 RNA disrupts polymerase DNA binding at the promoter, preventing the formation of an active closed complex around the DNA (Yakovchuk (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19307572).. 51 nucleotide sequence from 3' half is sufficient for binding to and repressing RNA polymerase II (Espinoza (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17307818).
B2 SINE RNA	None known	Conservation	Rodents: mouse, rat, chinese hamster (Krayev (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6296779)
B2 SINE RNA	None known	Misc	Known that upon heat shock RNA polymerase II is transiently repressed.. In humans Alu repeat RNAs appear to play the role B2 RNA does in rodents upon heat shock. Alu and B2 elements have different origins but show convergent evolution functionally.. B2 sequence provided is 177nt sequence specified by Espinoza et al. 2004 as mouse B2 RNA gene (region 121488-121665 of Mus musculus chromosome 18, clone RP23-6p18, GenBank accession number AC020972).
BACE1AS	NCRNA00177, BACE1-AS; FJ573250	Characteristics	~2 kb; two splice variants were identified for human and mouse BACE1-AS. Transcribed  from an intron of the beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) gene in antisense direction it also completely overlapps exon 6 of BACE-1 (Faghihi (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408).
BACE1AS	NCRNA00177, BACE1-AS; FJ573250	Expression	BACE1 and BACE1AS are co-expressed in a wide range of tissues and cell lines in mice and humans. BACE1 mRNA expression levels are higher than BACE1-AS levels across all tissues examined, except in Alzheimer's disease (AD) where, in contrast, BACE1-AS is expressed at a higher level in brain. Bace1 and Bace1-AS transcripts are also observed in various regions of the mouse brain (Faghihi (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408, Faghihi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507594).. Several cell stressors, such as high temperature, serum starvation, amyloid-beta 1-42, H2O2 and high glucose, specifically increase BACE1-AS RNA and BACE1 protein levels (Faghihi (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408).. Showed increased expression in sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) muscle fibers (possibly caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress). Nevertheless, unlike in AD and AD-transgenic mouse brain samples in which BACE1-AS transcript was increased more than the sense BACE1 transcript , in s-IBM muscle biopsies the reversed was found (Nogalska (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236612).. Mouse RNA stability was very close to median for lncRNAs, with a half-life 3.6 hr in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755). 
BACE1AS	NCRNA00177, BACE1-AS; FJ573250	Function	BACE1AS expression is elevated in Alzheimers disease (Faghihi (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408). It was shown to regulate BACE1 mRNA and protein expression in vitro and in vivo ie: over-expression, shRNA and siRNA knockdown of BACE1AS affected BACE1 expression, influencing amyloid-beta 1-42 levels (Faghihi (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408).. It was proposed that BACE1-AS and BACE1 form an RNA duplex and this increases the stability of BACE1 (Faghihi (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408). More recently, it was suggested that BACE1AS may prevent translational repression of BACE1 mRNA by miR-485-5p via masking the binding site for the microRNA. Supporting this hypothesis, BACE1AS over-expression prevented miRNA-induced suppression (Faghihi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507594). Expression of BACE1-AS as well as miR-485-5p are dysregulated in RNA samples from Alzheimer's disease subjects compared to control individuals (Faghihi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507594). . BACE1-AS may also be involved in sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM), whose muscle-fiber phenotype shares molecular similarities with Alzheimer-disease brain (including increased BACE1 protein). BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts are significantly increased in s-IBM, and experimental induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress increased both BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts. These results suggest that ER stress and increased BACE1-AS expression may be involved in s-IBM (Nogalska (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236612).
BACE1AS	NCRNA00177, BACE1-AS; FJ573250	Conservation	BACE1-AS transcript has been identified in mouse and humans, with a conserved association with BACE1 across species (Faghihi (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408).
BACE1AS	NCRNA00177, BACE1-AS; FJ573250	Misc	Mouse AK078885 and human CB960709 full-length clones are unspliced and are ~1.2kb- and 798b-long, but two spliced variants were extended by RACE by Faghini et al., 2008.
BACE1AS	NCRNA00177, BACE1-AS; FJ573250	Name	BACE1 antisense RNA
BC1	None known	Characteristics	152 nt; evolved from a tRNA Ala (DeChiara (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2437583).
BC1	None known	Expression	Expressed by a specific subset of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system; localises to dendrites (Tiedge (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1706516), or both axons and dendrites (Muslimov (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12040034, Centonze (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699670) in different subsets of neurons and in a developmentally regulated manner. . Decreased expression in brains of mice that suffer chronic epileptic seizures (GitaÃ­ (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20974111).. Also expressed in germ cells (Muslimov (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12040034).. Dendritic localisation mediated by an extended stem loop element (Rozhdestvensky (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11350036) in 5' 62 nucleotides (Muslimov (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9169532), containing two targeting codes a stem bulge motif that specifies nuclear export and a GA kink-turn (KT) motif that binds heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 and mediates transport to the distal ends of dendrites (Muslimov (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17074884).
BC1	None known	Function	Summary: Functions to regulate localised translation at dendrites, controlling neuron excitability and place learning. Lack of BC1 causes a susceptibility to epileptic seizures. . Binds eIF4A, eIF4B and PABP to repress translation initiation by blocking assembly of the 48S initiation complex (Wang (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12451124, Muddashetty (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162957, Wang (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16330711, Kondrashov (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16154588, Lin (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316401).. Translational repression is mediated by its 3' domain and A rich region (Muddashetty (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162957, Wang (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16330711, Kondrashov (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16154588).. Inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 4A helicase by uncoupling ATPase activity from helicase/ duplex unwinding activity (Lin (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316401).. By regulating localised translation BC1 can control neuron excitability; . ie: by regulating dopamine receptor levels and dopamine signalling in the striatum (Centonze (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699670) . ie: inhibiting translation activation from metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signalling (Zhong (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19675232). . Knock-out of BC1 in mouse affected exploratory behaviour and anxiety, leading to higher mortality in field experiments  (Skryabin (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12944471, Lewejohann (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15302134).. Brain phenotypes of BC1 knockout mice include neuronal hyperexcitability triggered by mGluR signaling or GABAa receptor stimulation which stimulates protein translation BC1 would act to repress (Zhong (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19675232, Zhong (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21124905). Epileptogenic susceptibility (epileptic activity and convulsive seizures) upon auditory stimulation (Zhong (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19675232, Zhong (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21124905) and defects in place learning (Zhong (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21124905). . The combination of BC1 and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) knockouts causes neuronal excitability, epileptogenesis, and place learning deficits of increased severity than individual knockouts suggesting BC1 and FMRP act independently to repress translation (Zhong (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21124905).
BC1	None known	Conservation	Evolved from a tRNA Ala (DeChiara (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2437583).. Rodent specific (Martignetti (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7692450).. BC1, BC200 and G22 likely form a family of independently exapted repetitive elements which have evolved to carry out similar functions in different mammalian species (Muddashetty (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162957, Khanam (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17175535, Lin (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316401). 
BC1	None known	Name	Brain Cytoplasmic RNA 1
BC200	BCYRN1 (brain cytoplasmic RNA 1)	Conservation	Anthropoid primates (monkeys, apes and humans) (Skryabin (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9847409).. BC200, BC1 and G22 likely form a family of independently exapted repetitive elements which have evolved to carry out similar functions in different mammalian species (Muddashetty (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162957, Khanam (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17175535). 
BC200	BCYRN1 (brain cytoplasmic RNA 1)	Characteristics	200 nucleotide ncRNA (Tiedge (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7684772) exapted from an Alu element (Watson (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2444875). Transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Martignetti (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8265590).. Three structural domains, 5' that shares homology with Alu elements, a central A rich region and a 3' unique region (Tiedge (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7684772). 
BC200	BCYRN1 (brain cytoplasmic RNA 1)	Misc.	More than 200 pseudogenes reported (Kuryshev (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11399078).
BC200	BCYRN1 (brain cytoplasmic RNA 1)	Expression	Expressed predominantly in different regions of the brain. Also shows low level expression in testis but not in other normal tissues examined (Watson (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2444875, Tiedge (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7684772, Kuryshev (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11399078). RNA sequencing of 11 human tissues confirmed up-regulation of expression in brain (hypothalamus) and low or no expression elsewhere (Castle (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668672).. Disregulated in cancer: expressed in a number of human tumours but not in corresponding normal tissue (Chen (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9422992). . Link with aging and Alzheimer disease: BC200 expression decreases with aging but is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD affected brain regions, expression increased with disease severity. RNA localisation showed intense perikaryal staining, showing build up of RNA in cell body (Mus (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17553964). . Like BC1 ncRNA found in rodents, BC200 also suggested to localise to dendrites (Tiedge (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7684772).  
BC200	BCYRN1 (brain cytoplasmic RNA 1)	Function	Binds several proteins including the signal recognition particle SRP9/14 heterodimer (Kremerskothen (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9605471), eukaryotic initiation factor 4A helicase (eIF4A) (Lin (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316401) and Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), binding to PABP requires the central A rich region (Muddashetty (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162957)..    . Inhibits translation in-vitro and in cultured cells similar to BC1.  BC200 binding to eIF4A inhibits it by uncoupling eIF4A ATPase activity from its helicase/ duplex unwinding activity (Lin (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316401). Translational inhibition also involves BC200 binding to to PABP (Kondrashov (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16154588). 
Beta 2.7 RNA	Beta2.7, TRL4 DE RNA, lncRNA2.7	Characteristics	2.7kb transcript, encoded in the herpesvirus HCMV genome. Unspliced and polyadenylated (Greenaway (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2436392).
Beta 2.7 RNA	Beta2.7, TRL4 DE RNA, lncRNA2.7	Expression	Beta2.7 kb transcript is found predominantly in the cytoplasm and does associate with polysomes (Greenaway (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2436392, Greenaway (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2436392)(McSharry (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12917473). It is an early transcript expressed upon infection (12 to 24 hours), and rapidly accumulated in infected cells, accounting to ~20% of viral RNA transcription (Greenaway (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2436392, Greenaway (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2436392).
Beta 2.7 RNA	Beta2.7, TRL4 DE RNA, lncRNA2.7	Function	Beta2.7 RNA has a fundamental role in preventing stress response and apoptosis of the host cell, by binding to components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotideâubiquinone oxido-reductase). Beta2.7 specifically binds and prevents re-localization of essential complex I subunit genes associated with retinoid/interferon-induced mortality-19 (GRIMâ19), in response to apoptotic stimuli. This interaction is also important for stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondrial ATP production, preventing metabolic dysfunction, which is essential for completion of the virus' life cycle (Reeves (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17540903).. Beta2.7 transcripts have also been shown to protect endothelial cells from rat aorta against apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion injury, which also involves complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Overexpression of beta2.7 RNA reduced reactive oxygen species production and inhibited apoptosis (Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20036157).
Beta 2.7 RNA	Beta2.7, TRL4 DE RNA, lncRNA2.7	Misc	A potential open reading frame of 170 amino acids was identified close to the 5'-terminus of the gene (Greenaway (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2436392), but no protein product of this RNA has ever been detected in infected cells.
Beta 2.7 RNA	Beta2.7, TRL4 DE RNA, lncRNA2.7	Conservation	Beta2.7 sequence is highly conserved not only in HCMV clinical isolates but also in the common laboratory strains, demonstrating that the gene sequence was not substantially modified during prolonged in vitro passage (McSharry (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12917473).
Beta-globin transcripts	None known	Characteristics	>1 kb, intergenic RNAs transcribed from the beta-globin locus.
Beta-globin transcripts	None known	Expression	Dynamically expressed during erythroid cell development.. Nuclear localised.
Beta-globin transcripts	None known	Function	Intergenic transcripts (or their transcription) are believed to participate in the developmental switch of beta-globin cluster genes, with proposed roles in chromatin remodeling and long-range cis-activation. RNAs may be processed by RNAi machinery.
Beta-globin transcripts	None known	Conservation	N/A
Beta-globin transcripts	None known	Misc	N/A
Beta-MHC antisense transcripts	intergenic beta MHC RNA, beta RNA; MHC bII, aII and xII NATs	Characteristics	Originally described as a ~6-kb transcript that initiates in the intergenic region between the alpha and beta myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes, ~2 kb downstream of the beta-MHC gene and transcribed across the entire gene in the antisense orientation (Haddad (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12851393).. Natural antisense transcripts in the MHC cluster have been described forming three major products in rats, antisense to MHC IIa, IIx, and IIb genes. These antisense RNAs are named aII, xII, and bII NATs, respectively (Pandorf (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17030512). The aII NAT begins in the IIa-IIx intergenic region in close proximity to the IIx promoter, extends across the 27-kb IIa MHC gene, and continues to the IIa MHC gene promoter (Pandorf (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17030512).
Beta-MHC antisense transcripts	intergenic beta MHC RNA, beta RNA; MHC bII, aII and xII NATs	Expression	Expressed in cardiac muscle development (Haddad (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17982008). Increasingly expressed following birth or in response to increases in T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) thyroid hormone.. Expression is inversely correlated with beta-MHC levels: for example, expression of the antisense beta MHC RNA under altered thyroid state and in diabetes directly correlates with that of the alpha MHC mRNA, but negatively correlates with beta mRNA expression (Haddad (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12851393). . Negative correlation has also been observed between the beta MHC mRNA expression and the antisense beta-RNA in response to aortic constriction-induced pressure overload, in which the beta-MHC gene is up-regulated while the alpha-MHC gene is down-regulated (Haddad (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16415074).. Expression of MHC "aII" antisense is also up-regulated in muscles after spinal cord isolation (SI) in rats, and was negatively correlated with MHC IIa expression and positively correlated with MHC IIx gene expression (Pandorf (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17030512).
Beta-MHC antisense transcripts	intergenic beta MHC RNA, beta RNA; MHC bII, aII and xII NATs	Function	Proposed to negatively regulate beta-MHC expression to coordinate the cardiac transition marked by the switch from beta- to alpha-MHC, during early neonatal development, and in adult heart in response to diabetes and to hypothyroid state (Luther (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9632112) (Haddad (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17982008).
Beta-MHC antisense transcripts	intergenic beta MHC RNA, beta RNA; MHC bII, aII and xII NATs	Conservation	Comparative analyses of the MHC intergenic DNA sequence across five mammalian species (human, rat, mouse, hamster, and rabbit) indicates a conserved region that is proposed to be a common regulatory region for the alpha and antisense beta promoter (Haddad (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12851393).
bft	bereft	Characteristics	Two alternatively spliced ~3.5kb and ~6.5kb isoforms (Hardiman (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12019237).. Another longer extended isoform that is a precursor transcript for miR-263a has also been identified (Graveley (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21179090).
bft	bereft	Expression	Expressed in external sensory organs of the embryonic peripheral nervous system. Bristles in Drosophila are sensory organs and bereft is expressed in structural support cells during bristle formation.. Shows a punctate and possibly peri-nuclear localization
bft	bereft	Function	Required for bristle morphogenesis in external sensory organs.. Appears to act downstream of cut and tramtrack
bft	bereft	Name	bft: bereft
bft	bereft	Misc	NCBI seq accession for two bft transcripts are: NR_001644.1 and NR_001643.1
BORG	None known	Characteristics	~2.8kb. Spliced and polyadenylated RNA with three exons.. BORG RNA contains a number of repeat sequences.
BORG	None known	Expression	Identified in a myoblast cell line (C2C12) trans-differentiating into osteoblastic cells. . Immediate early response gene to bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), expressed within 2 hrs, peaked between 12-24 hours before declining back to basal levels.. Expression induced by BMPs and osteogenic proteins in multiple cell types that respond to BMP signaling.
BORG	None known	Function	Knockdown of BORG via transfection of antisense oligonucleotides partially inhibits BMP-induced differentiation of C2C12 cells into osteoblastic cells. Proposed involvement in bone morphogenesis.
BORG	None known	Conservation	Likely to be rodent specific as much of locus (and transcript) consists of rodent specific repeats. Unknown if a transcript is expressed in rat.
BORG	None known	Name	BMP/OP-responsive gene (BORG) RNA
BORG	None known	Misc	BMP: bone morphogenic protein. OP: osteogenic protein
Bsr	Rian	Characteristics	LncRNA from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted region (Komine (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10095072, Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654).. Similar to Rian locus in mouse and humans with a lncRNA containing intronic snoRNAs, except the Bsr locus contains a ~100kb rat specific sequence containing 86 0.9kb tandem repeats (Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654, Komine (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10095072).  Bsr appears to have evolved through a massive duplication based expansion of some snoRNAs present in the ancestral locus (Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654). . Tandem repeats in the Bsr locus consist of an intron containing the RBII-36 snoRNA and a Bsr lncRNA exon (CavaillÃ© (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11346658, Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654).. Multiple products are detected from the Bsr locus consisting of varying numbers of the 0.9kb tandem repeat from which the ~75 bp snoRNA is spliced out (Komine (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10095072, CavaillÃ© (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11346658).
Bsr	Rian	Expression	Imprinted: Maternally expressed (Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654). Like snoRD115-HG and snoRD116-HG, one Bsr allele can show evidence of less compacted chromatin, this is almost always the transcribed allele (Vitali (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20016068).. Bsr is expressed predominantly in the CNS both during development and in adults (Komine (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10095072) as is the RBII-36 snoRNA cluster (CavaillÃ© (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11346658).. Nuclear localisation (Komine (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10095072). Mature, spliced Bsr was not localised to the nucleolus, unlike most mature RBII-36 (CavaillÃ© (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11346658, Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654). Bsr was present as mutiple small foci in the interchromatin space, often found on periphery of SC35 speckles but not found in SC35 speckles or paraspeckles (Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654). Did not co-localise with rat snoRD115-HG or snoRD116-HG, two other nuclear retained snoRNA containing lncRNAs (Vitali (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20016068). . Upon cellular stress a portion of Bsr relocates to the cytoplasm where it associates with stress granules (Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654).
Bsr	Rian	Conservation	Bsr and Rian/MEG8/Irm are not highly conserved between species (CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206). However, some Rian exons show good homology to Bsr and while many snoRNAs are specific to one species others are homologous (Hatada (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481034, CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206).
Bsr	Rian	Summary	Comparing human, mouse and rat: All contain ncRNA gene(s) with intronic snoRNAs at this locus. The snoRNAs vary between species, but there are some homologous snoRNAs between each suggesting an evolutionary history with species specific snoRNA addition and duplication (CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206).. The expression profiles of Bsr, Rian/Irm/MEG8 and the snoRNAs they contain are similar between rat, human and mouse.
Bsr	Rian	Name	 Bsr (brain specific repetitive) RNA
Bsr	Rian	Misc	UCSC browser link is from mapping of mouse Rian/Meg8 onto rat and may not be precisely representative of full length Bsr, the sequence for which is not available.
BX118339	Hs.112750, linc-MBOAT1-4: TCONS_00012107,  linc-MBOAT1-4: TCONS_00012678	Characteristics	Longest identified isoform is 738bp with 4 exons. Deep sequencing has also identified two shorter isoforms (Cabili (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21890647).. Some exons overlap multiple SINEs
BX118339	Hs.112750, linc-MBOAT1-4: TCONS_00012107,  linc-MBOAT1-4: TCONS_00012678	Expression	Transcript isoform(s) expressed in testis (Cabili (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21890647) and also reported in fetal brain (Vandeweyer (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22245136).
BX118339	Hs.112750, linc-MBOAT1-4: TCONS_00012107,  linc-MBOAT1-4: TCONS_00012678	Function	Transcript disrupted by a balanced translocation, 46,XY,t(2;6)(p15;p22.3), in a patient with West Syndrome (a form of infant epilepsy). Lack of effect on other nearby genes or presence of mutations in known West Syndrome disease genes leads to possible implication of BX118339 in the clinical phenotype (Vandeweyer (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22245136).
CAR Intergenic 10	Intergenic10, CR611911, AK055628	Name	CAR10: Chromatin Associated RNA 10
CAR Intergenic 10	Intergenic10, CR611911, AK055628	Characteristics	Positioned between 3' ends of of FANK1 (fibronectin) and ADAM12 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 12) genes, with an overlap of a few hundred base pairs with ADAM12.
CAR Intergenic 10	Intergenic10, CR611911, AK055628	Expression	CAR Intergenic 10, ADAM12 and FANK1 are co-expressed in different tissues, including placenta, brain and a human skin fibroblast (HF) cell line. . CAR Intergenic 10 was most highly expressed in HF cells and very lowly expressed in brain, with placenta in-between.
CAR Intergenic 10	Intergenic10, CR611911, AK055628	Function	Positively regulates gene expression of FANK1 and ADAM12 neighboring genes through modulating the chromatin structure in cis, as siRNA knock-down of the Intergenic10 ncRNA results in reduced expression of both FANK1 and ADAM12 mRNAs, with a significant decrease in the level of active chromatin mark H3K4me2 on FANK1 and ADAM12 promoters.. Knock-down of the ncRNA had no effect on the expression of two tested distal genes, UROS and DOCK1.. Note: Despite its overlap with the 3' end of ADAM12, Intergenic 10 is not simply an Adam12 3'UTR, as siRNA knockdown of Adam12 failed to decrease FANK1 expression unlike knockdown of CAR Intergenic 10. 
CCND1 associated ncRNAs	None known	Characteristics	Multiple ncRNAs transcribed from the promoter region of the cyclin D (CCND1) gene.. Transcripts of ~200nuc, ~330nuc and longer from both strands found within 2kb of the CCND1 transcription start site.
CCND1 associated ncRNAs	None known	Expression	Expression induced by DNA damage signals.. Transcripts highly enriched in chromatin.. Transcripts expressed from PROMPT (promoter upstream transcripts) regions, PROMPT transcripts are degraded by the exosome and generally highly unstable (Preker (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19056938).
CCND1 associated ncRNAs	None known	Function	Regulates gene expression of cyclin D1. . ncRNAs have free ssRNA region plus RNA:DNA duplex region to tether them to the CCND1 locus.. Interaction of ncRNA ssRNA region with RNA-binding protein TLS (translocated in liposarcoma) promotes allosteric modification of the protein, leading to inhibition of CREB-binding protein and histone acetyltransferase activities to repress cyclin D1.. Promoter associated RNAs that can regulate expression of their associated protein coding gene by acting as a guide for a generic protein transcriptional regulator. 
CCND1 associated ncRNAs	None known	Misc	Transcripts are not exactly defined so Browser link below is to the 2kb upstream of the CCND1 transcription start site.
CDR1 AS	CDR1 NAT
	Characteristics	Identified as ~1.5kb (no internal splicing) and ~1.3kb (with internal splicing). . Circular transcript in which 5â and 3â ends have splice donor and acceptor sequences and are spliced together.. Also contains 2 internal splice sites.
CDR1 AS	CDR1 NAT
	Expression	Highly expressed in human adult and fetal brain and spinal cord. Expression in brain considerably higher than that of CDR1 mRNA. Modest expression in other human tissues including heart, lung, thymus and thyroid.. Expressed in mouse brain (cerebellum and cerebrum).
CDR1 AS	CDR1 NAT
	Function	First lncRNA identified as a miRNA target.. CDR1 AS functions to stabilize CDR1 mRNA, as a decrease in CDR1 AS levels leads to a decrease in the expression level of the sense CDR1 mRNA. Conversely, the sense transcript does not act to stabilize the antisense lncRNA and appears to destabilize it, perhaps through a feedback mechanism. . CDR1 AS and hence CDR1 sense are regulated by miR-671. A conserved miR-671 binding site is present in the antisense transcript (a site which corresponds to near the transcriptional start site of the sense CDR1 mRNA). miR-671 localises to the nucleus and can repress CDR1 AS and CDR1 sense mRNA.. Effect of miR-671 does not appear to be through an epigenetic mechanism, instead it causes Ago2 mediated cleavage and down-regulation of CDR1 AS.. Mechanism for how CDR1 AS stabilizes CDR1 is not clear but it does not appear to be due to the lncRNA acting as a miR-671 sponge.
CDR1 AS	CDR1 NAT
	Conservation	CDR1 AS found in both humans and mouse.
CDR1 AS	CDR1 NAT
	Misc	Note: Evidence of antisense transcription across locus from a number of tissues present in Illumnia Body Atlas (IBA2). These suggest antisense transcripts can extend in both 5â and 3â directions and can be longer than 1.5kb. Whether these represent longer or primary CDR1 AS transcript is unclear.. AK054921 may represent an isoform although the sequence does not reach the miR-671 binding site.
CDR1 AS	CDR1 NAT
	Name	CDR1 Antisense. CDR1 Natural antisense transcript
Centromeric alpha-satellite RNA	None known	Characteristics	Transcribed RNAs contain monomers if not multimers of a 171bp repeat but actual length of transcripts were not defined.. Alpha-satellite RNA comes from the centromeric repeats of many chromosomes.
Centromeric alpha-satellite RNA	None known	Function	Regulates the assembly of the centromeric kinetochore.. At interphase alpha-centromeric RNA is localised to the nucleolus. It is able to bind multiple centromeric proteins (CENPC1 and INCENP), which it sequesters in this subdomain. . CENPC1, a core kinetochore protein, appears to bind directly to alpha-satellite RNA.. Upon mitosis alpha-centromeric RNA re-localises to chromosomal centromeres, allowing localisation of CENPC1, INCENP and survivin (an INCENP-interacting protein) to the metaphase centromere and assembly of the kinetochore. . The regulated localisation of alpha-centromeric RNA hence regulates the activity of centromeric proteins and assembly of the kinetochore.
Centromeric alpha-satellite RNA	None known	Misc	CENPC1 (centromere protein C 1)  . INCENP (inner centromere protein antigens 135/155kDa) . Centromeric sequences from a number of chromosomes were investigated, the UCSC browser location given below is just one example of a sequence that could have been detected.
COLDAIR	COLD ASSISTED INTRONIC NONCODING RNA	Characteristics	~1.1kb sense transcript from first intron of FLC. 5â capped, but not generally polyadenylated. RNA polymerase II transcript. Transcriptional start site within vernalization response element (VRE), which is required for proper vernalization dependant repression of FLC and appears to act as the promoter for COLDAIR.
COLDAIR	COLD ASSISTED INTRONIC NONCODING RNA	Expression	Transcriptional start site within vernalization response element (VRE), which is required for proper vernalization dependant repression of FLC and appears to act as the promoter for COLDAIR.. Expression specifically and transiently induced during vernalization / cold exposure with a peak at around day 20 and return to baseline levels by day 30. . Nb: this expression pattern is similar to COOLAIR, but up to 10 days delayed.. COLDAIR transcription may be shut off in negative feedback loop, where it shuts off transcription within the FLC gene including its own.  
COLDAIR	COLD ASSISTED INTRONIC NONCODING RNA	Function	COLDAIR is required for stable repression of FLC after vernalization and a lack of COLDAIR lead to late flowering after vernalization.. COLDAIR binds PRC2 complex protein CURLY LEAF (CLF), with maximal interaction after 20 days of vernalization / cold exposure. . COLDAIR is required to recruit PRC2 to the FLC locus allowing deposition of the repressive H3K27me3 chromatin mark.. COLDAIR did not impact the expression of other genes that repress flowering. 
COLDAIR	COLD ASSISTED INTRONIC NONCODING RNA	Background	Epigenetic represssion of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is required for Arabodopsis flowering in spring.. Polycomb repressive complex 2 is required for FLC repression.. COLDAIR is distinct from COOLAIR - http://www.lncrnadb.org/Detail.aspx?TKeyID=185, which does not appear to interact with PRC2.
COOLAIR	None known	Characteristics	Multiple spliced, polyadenylated isoforms. Short version ~400bp, long version ~750 bp (Swiezewski (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010688).. Transcription initiates just 3' of the FLC polyA site. Some isoforms terminate just beyond the start of the FLC gene (antisense transcription covers the entire FLC gene) (Swiezewski (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010688).
COOLAIR	None known	Expression	Antisense transcription over much of FLC locus. Generally shows a positive correlation with FLC transcripts, except upon cold treatment (vernalization) (Swiezewski (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010688).. Antisense transcripts show a transient accumulation upon cold treatment with a peak after 10-14 days (Swiezewski (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010688, Heo (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21127216), before declining with further prolonged cold or when plants returned to warmth. Transcription of FLC decreases during cold treatment (Swiezewski (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010688).
COOLAIR	None known	Function	COOLAIR suggested to function in early cold induced silencing of FLC transcription (Swiezewski (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010688).. COOLAIR promoter could silence some reporter genes. Suggests COOLAIR may function through transcriptional interference, although a function for the transcripts has not been tested (Swiezewski (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010688).
COOLAIR	None known	Misc	COOLAIR short accession: GQ342259.1. COOLAIR long accession: GQ352646.1 . COOLAIR is distinct from COLDAIR - http://www.lncrnadb.org/Detail.aspx?TKeyID=272, which has been functionally characterized.
COOLAIR	None known	Name	COOLAIR: cold induced long antisense intragenic RNA (Swiezewski (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010688).
CYP4A22-AS1	Noncoding RNA activating3: ncRNA-a3, ENST00000444042.2
	Characteristics	Spliced, up to 4 exons, ~920 nt transcript (Ãrom (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887892). . Loci covers ~ 80kb and is antisense to CYP4A22 and CYP4Z1 (Ãrom (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887892).. Transcribed bidirectionally with PDZK1IP1-AS1 - http://www.lncrnadb.org/Detail.aspx?TKeyID=276, downstream from TAL1 and PDZK1IP1 on same strand (Ãrom (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887892).. In-vitro translation showed no sign of protein product (Ãrom (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887892).

	Expression	Expressed and functionally characterized in MCF7 cells (Ãrom (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887892).. CYP4A22-AS1 identified as enriched in K562, HelaS3 and HepG2 nuclear fractions (Derrien (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22955988). 
CYP4A22-AS1	Noncoding RNA activating3: ncRNA-a3, ENST00000444042.2
	Function	CYP4A22-AS1 expression stimulates TAL1 gene expression (in MCF7 cells) (Ãrom (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887892).

Human: LOC729082, linc-NUSAP1-1, OIP5-AS1,<br></br>
Mouse: 1700020I14Rik, linc1510	Function	Required for normal embronyic development in Zebrafish. Morpholinos to decrease transcript level or block conserved (miR-7 recognition) site had neural development defects and short tails.. - Lack of functional cyrano caused small heads and eyes, âdefect in neural tube opening, loss of NeuroD-positive cells in the retina and tectum and enlarged nasal placodesâ.. Defects could be recused by mature zebrafish cyrano transcript as well as the human and mouse orthologues.. Conserved site was necessary but not sufficient to explain cyrano function in zebrafish.

Human: LOC729082, linc-NUSAP1-1, OIP5-AS1,<br></br>
Mouse: 1700020I14Rik, linc1510	Characteristics	Has similar structural characteristics in different vertebrate species. Spliced transcript with long (4-8kb) terminal exon which contains a number of conserved sequences.. Zebrafish: ~4.5kb, 3 exons with long terminal exon. Terminal exon contain several DNA transposons. Convergent transcription with oip5.. Human: ~8.8kb transcript has positional synteny, generally 3 or 4 exons, full length transcript has a long terminal exon..

Mouse: 1700020I14Rik, linc1510	Expression	Expressed in zebrafish nervous system. Brain and notochord at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf), expression at 72 hpf also includes zebrafish spinal cord.. Mouse and human homolgoues are widely expressed in adult and developing tissues and cell lines including the brain (ENCODE, Gascoigne et al).. RNA stability half-life of mouse homologue was 3-4 hr in neuroblastoma cells, close to lncRNA median (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
cyrano	Zebrafish: linc-oip5, si:dkey-71p21.9, <br></br>
Human: LOC729082, linc-NUSAP1-1, OIP5-AS1,<br></br>
Mouse: 1700020I14Rik, linc1510	Conservation	Long terminal exon shows a number of conserved sequences within tetrapods. One ~300nt highly conserved sequence contains a 67 nt sequence conserved between tetrapods and zebrafish, a 26nt subregion of which is almost perfectly conserved in vertebrates and is hypothesised to be a miR-7 binding site. 
DHFR upstream transcripts	DHFR minor transcript 5'-UTR	Characteristics	DHFR upstream transcripts initiate from an upstream minor promoter of the DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) gene and extend from approximately 400 nucleotide upstream of the 5'-untranslated region of DHFR (which corresponds to DHFR major/core promoter), to the second intron of the DHFR gene where they terminate (Masters (1985) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859520, Martianov (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763). Therefore, the region located between minor and major transcript initiation sites (~400 bp) corresponds to a noncoding transcript and is a promoter of DHFR.. Discrete DHRF upstream initiating transcripts of diverse sizes have been reported, including five major discrete species with sizes of 4.3, 3.8, 3.1, 2.1, and 1.0 kb and four minor ones with sizes of 7.3, 5.0, 1.4, and 0.8kb. Primarily in the poly(A)+ fraction (Masters (1985) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859520).. DHFR upstream transcripts adopt a series of structures in vitro that are dependent on the G-tract encompassed in its sequence (Blume (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786).
DHFR upstream transcripts	DHFR minor transcript 5'-UTR	Expression	Enriched in the nucleus (Masters (1985) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859520).. At least six minor 5' ends mapping upstream of the DHFR gene correspond to approximately 1% of the DHFR-specific polysomal polyA RNA. Most of these species have been found in 6A3 cells, VA2-B cells (the parental line of 6A3), and in HeLa cells (Masters (1985) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859520).. DHFR upstream transcripts accumulate in a population of serum-starved, contact-inhibited (quiescent) U2OS cells, in which the levels of DHFR mRNA are markedly reduced (Martianov (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763).
DHFR upstream transcripts	DHFR minor transcript 5'-UTR	Function	Initial studies indicated that DHFR upstream transcripts could impair the formation of the preinitiation complex (PIC) on the major promoter in vitro, thereby repressing the transcriptional activity of the major DHFR promoter (Blume (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786). DHFR upstream transcripts were shown to inhibit transcription from the DHFR core promoter in-trans in a concentration-dependent manner in in-vitro runoff transcription assays. Transcription factor binding sites positioned between the minor and major promoters within the DHFR gene were indicated to be affected by the upstream regulatory transcripts, which selectively sequestered transcription factor Sp3, and to a lesser extent Sp1, preventing their binding to the DHRF core promoter. The sequestration of Sp3 and Sp1 by the DHFR upstream transcripts appears to involve an altered conformation of the RNA, and a structural domain of the protein distinct from that required for binding DNA (Blume (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786). However, in-vitro experiments confirmed that transcription from the major promoter could be suppressed in-trans in the absence of Sp1 or any other upstream activating sequence (Akoulitchev (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7566158, Martianov (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763).. A more recent study demonstrated that these promoter associated transcripts act as interfering transcripts, directly interacting with TFIIB and dissociate the PIC efficiently to repress DHFR expression (Martianov (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763). Transcription of the regulatory RNA in trans has a repressive effect on the major DHFR promoter only when the transcript contained the sequence of the core major DHFR promoter (Martianov (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763). In addition, the major DHFR promoter is GC-rich and contains several G-track sequences (Blume (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786), and specific and stable triplex structures have been shown to form between the DHFR upstream transcripts and the major promoter, which may contribute to promoter targeting and repression in vivo (Martianov (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763) (Blume (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786).. A comparison of in-vitro transcription from templates containing DHFR minor, major or both promoters in their original sequential order indicated very low transcriptional activity when the minor promoter preceded the major one, but robust transcription from the major promoter, suggesting that transcriptional interference in-cis may also play a role in DHFR inhibition by DHFR upstream transcripts (Martianov (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763).
DHFR upstream transcripts	DHFR minor transcript 5'-UTR	Misc	Unpublished analysis of the epigenetic effects of DHFR upstream transcripts indicated similarities to epigenetic markers associated with transcriptional gene silencing induced by the targeted application of synthetic antigene RNAs complementary to the promoter regions of mammalian genes (Martianov (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763).. DHFR is the major target of methotrexate, a key component in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. DNA variations of major promoter/noncoding transcript region and specifc haplotype subtypes involving this region have been associated with childhood ALL, including associations with high-risk patients and lower event-free survival. One particular haplotype (Haplotype *1b) is associated with higher DHFR expression (Al-Shakfa (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19861437).
Dio3os	Dio3as	Characteristics	Antisense and head to head with Dio3 from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprtinted locus (Hernandez (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14962667). A large number of isoforms are transcribed through alternative splicing and start sites some of which overlap Dio3 (Hernandez (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14962667).. Also overlaps a provisional microRNA miR1247.
Dio3os	Dio3as	Expression	Various DIO3OS isoforms are expressed in a wide range of human tissues including adult testis, adrenal cortex, heart, bladder, uterus, placenta and fetal lung (Hernandez (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14962667).  . Expressed in embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue in mouse. Weakly expressed in several neonatal and adult tissues: brain and liver (adult only), intestine and tougue (neonate only),  kidney and lung (expressed in both) (Tierling (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16309881).  . Analysis in different cell culture lines showed co-expression of DIO3OS transcripts and DIO3 (Kester (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16935842). Conversely differentiation of mature brown adipose tissue (BAT) adipocytes from precursor cells showed that Dio3 was only expressed in the proliferating precursors while a specific Dio3os isoform was expressed only in differentiated adipocytes (Hernandez (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17510246).. Not imprinted in mouse (Tierling (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16309881).
Dio3os	Dio3as	Conservation	Aside from the short exon 1, there is poor sequence conservation and no conserved ORFs between mouse and human Dio3os (Hernandez (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14962667).

DLG2AS	PSZA11q14, SZ-1	Characteristics	Anti-sense to DLG2 intron.. ~4.5kb and ~7kb unspliced transcripts differ in 3' position.. Contains a number of repeat sequences.. Despite its position in an intron, promoter elements could be identified upstream of the Dlg2as start site.
DLG2AS	PSZA11q14, SZ-1	Expression	Expression downregulated in multiple brain regions in some patients with schizophrenia (by PCR).. Expression identified in a number of brain areas (by northern blot).. Near ubiquitous expression was identified in different brain areas and tissues (by PCR).. Some care must be taken interpreting the RT-PCR expression results as they appear to have been carried out with random hexamers and therefore may not differentiate between Dlg2as levels and detectable levels Dlg2 intron/ Dlg2 pre-mRNA. However the northern blot analysis does confirm expression of discrete transcripts from this intronic locus in different brain areas.
DLG2AS	PSZA11q14, SZ-1	Conservation	Sequence shows less than 50% homology with mouse.
DLG2AS	PSZA11q14, SZ-1	Misc	Genbank accession: AF525782.1 for Dlg2as is incorrectly listed as an mRNA but is actually a ~10kb genomic clone containing Dlg2as.. Exact start and stop not defined but:. Longer isoform (~7kb) appears to end around: chr11:84,604,583 (hg19). Shorter isoform (~4.5kb) around: chr11:84,602,058 (hg19)
DLG2AS	PSZA11q14, SZ-1	Name	DLG2AS: DLG2 antisense RNA. PSZA11q14: putative schizophrenia associated gene from 11q14
Dlx1as	None known	Characteristics	Spliced, polyadenylated ~2.8kb transcript (McGuinness (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8812481)..  . Expressed from a highly conserved enhancer element downstream of Dlx1. Second exon overlaps exons and introns of Dlx1 in the antisense direction (Dinger (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562676).
Dlx1as	None known	Expression	Dlx1as and Dlx1 were progressively more highly expressed during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (Dinger (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562676).. Dlx1as and Dlx1 were both up-regulated during differentiation of neuronal progenitors to GABAergic neurons in vitro, but down-regulated during oligodendrocyte differentiation from the same progenitors (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068).. Expressed in developing forebrain with highest expressive in the subventricular zone (Liu (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9415433).. Expressed in adult mouse brain, including in regions associated with neurogenesis (anterior subventricular zone, rostral migratory stream, and olfactory bulb) similar to the expression of Dlx1 and Dlx2 (Dinger (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562676).
Dlx1as	None known	Conservation	Exon one initiates from an enhancer highly conserved in therian mammals (found in oppossum as well as placental mammals). Second exon also overlaps highly conserved sequences but this is mostly Dlx1 exon regions.
Dlx1as	None known	Misc	Dlx1: distal-less homeobox 1. Transcription factor with an important role in brain development that is important role in specifying neuronal cell fate.
dUHGs	dUHG1, dUHG2, dUHG3, dUHG4, dUHG5, dUHG7, dUHG8	Characteristics	7 known dUHGs (dUHG 1-5, 7-8), spliced noncoding RNAs that contain intronic snoRNAs (Tycowski (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11302516, Huang (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15987805). Nb: UHG6 identified as protein coding.. These 7 genes contain around half the known box C/D snoRNAs in Drosophila with snoRNAs in almost every intron (Huang (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15987805).. dUHG1 & 2 transcriptional start sites have characteristics of the 5' TOP gene family (Tycowski (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11302516).
dUHGs	dUHG1, dUHG2, dUHG3, dUHG4, dUHG5, dUHG7, dUHG8	Expression	dUHG1 and 2 can be stabilised by inhibition of protein synthesis suggesting they are normally degraded by nonsense mediated decay (Tycowski (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11302516).
dUHGs	dUHG1, dUHG2, dUHG3, dUHG4, dUHG5, dUHG7, dUHG8	Conservation	dUHG 1 and 2 contain snoRNAs that appear homologous to some of those found in UHG/SNHG1 and Gas5/SNHG2. Calling these genes homologous is not straightforward however, ie: both dUHG1 and 2 contain snoRNAs found in UHG, dUHG2 also contain snoRNAs found within introns of mammalian protein coding genes.
dUHGs	dUHG1, dUHG2, dUHG3, dUHG4, dUHG5, dUHG7, dUHG8	Name	dUHG: Drosophila U snoRNA Host Gene.
dUHGs	dUHG1, dUHG2, dUHG3, dUHG4, dUHG5, dUHG7, dUHG8	Misc	GeneID NCBI Entrez Gene. dUHG1: 3772106. dUHG2: 3772246. dUHG3: 3772557. dUHG4: 8673973. dUHG5: 8673975. dUHG7: 8674061. dUHG8: 8674065.  
dutA	None known	Characteristics	~1.3 kb, transcribed by RNAP II, and exported to the cytoplasm (Yoshida (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8127653).
dutA	None known	Expression	"Developmentally regulated" during Dictyostelium discoideum multicellular organization: induced during aggregation and exhibits a distinct expression pattern during stalk formation, ceasing with the onset of culmination (Yoshida (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8127653) (Kumimoto (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7488100) (Maeda (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796308). dutA expression is not affected by cAMP signaling but requires protein kinase A (PKA) signaling (Kumimoto (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8764472).. A Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) study indicates that dutA is the most abundant polyadenylated RNA in the Dictyostelium transcriptome, expressed at a level almost twice that of the next highest gene (Whitney (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20309825).. A microarray analysis of D. discoideum cells infected with Legionella pneumophila indicated down-regulation of dutA mRNA, suggesting a possible function of dutA in hostâpathogen interaction (Farbrother (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469056).
dutA	None known	Function	The function of dutA remains unclear. Disruption of dutA showed no morphological phenotype under normal conditions of growth and development (Yoshida (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8127653), which may be due to functional redundancy. . However, over-expression of dutA segments suppresses mutations in the signaling component Dd-STATa (the functional homolog of metazoan STAT transcriptional factors), rescuing stalk formation that is impaired in the mutants and indicating an inhibitory role of dutA in culmination. It also restores expression of target genes and tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that dutA acts upstream of Dd-STATa in the signal transduction pathway and has an important role in Dictyostelium multicellular development switch (Shimada (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17435008).
dutA	None known	Misc	Contains some peculiar sequence motifs.
dutA	None known	Name	DutA: Development-specific but UnTranslatable RNA A
E2F4 antisense	None known	Characteristics	~5.5kb transcript originating from the 3'UTR of E2F4. Antisense to E2F4. 
E2F4 antisense	None known	Expression	Localised to the nucleus and the cytoplasm although it is mainly cytoplasmic.. Expression identified in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells.. Expression is driven by Wnt signalling with beta-catenin and TCF/Lef binding to the E2F4 3'UTR to upregulate E2F4 antisense transcription.
E2F4 antisense	None known	Function	Expression of E2F4 antisense lead to a decrease in E2F4 protein levels and reduced binding of E2F4 to its target gene promoters. This effect did not occur with, and could be blocked by, an E2F4 3'UTR sense construct.. Disruption of Wnt signalling is very common in colorectal cancer and it was hypothesised that induction of E2F4 antisense by Wnt signaling may contribute to carcinogenesis by reducing levels of the E2F4 cell cycle repressor.   
E2F4 antisense	None known	Misc	E2F4 acts in cell cycle controls where it is thought to act as a repressor of proliferation.. Neither the sequence nor exact coordinates of E2F4 antisense are available.
EBER1 and EBER2 RNAs	None known		EBER: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA
EBER1 and EBER2 RNAs	None known	Characteristics	Encoded by Epstein-Barr virus. EBER genes are separated by 161 base pairs (Rosa (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9279391, Lerner (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6262773).. EBER1: 167nt, EBER2: 172nt. Show significant sequence similarity with each other. Heterogeneity resides at the 3' termini (Rosa (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9279391, Lerner (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6262773). Highly structured, resulting in the formation of several stable stem-loops (Glickman (1988) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2828685).. Transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Possess 5' pppA termini. Non-polyadenylated (Rosa (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9279391, Lerner (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6262773).
EBER1 and EBER2 RNAs	None known	Expression	Highly expressed during EBV latency in infection of many cell types and all associated human malignancies (EBERs are the most abundantly expressed RNAs during latency).. Nuclear localisation.
EBER1 and EBER2 RNAs	None known	Function	Bind to La autoantigen protein (Rosa (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9279391, Lerner (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6262773) and PKR in vitro, and have been suggested to block PKR activity and confer resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis of host cells (Clarke (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1673026, Sharp (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7901835, Nanbo (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16160154), although inhibition of PKR has not been observed in vivo (Ruf (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16282456).. EBER-1 interacts with RPL22 (ribosomal protein L22), which is known to interact with components of different viruses (Dobbelstein (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7494316, Fok (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16556938). EBER-1 mediates stable relocalisation of L22 from nucleoli to nucleoplasm in EBV-infected cells, which is critical for EBER-dependent functions (Houmani (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640998). Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells expressing mutated EBER-1 RNAs incapable of binding L22 have reduced capacity to enhance BL cell growth (Houmani (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640998).. Role in the growth and maintenance of BL cell malignant phenotype (Shimizu (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8057484, Ruf (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11024153). Also contribute to the growth of other B-cell lymphoma-, gastric carcinoma-, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma-derived cell lines (Iwakiri (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14612496, Iwakiri (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15608666, Yamamoto (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11068051).. Inhibit alpha interferon-induced apoptosis in latently infected B-cell lines. EBER RNAs induce the expression of interleukin (IL)-10 in BL cells (Kitagawa (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11118209), as well as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 in gastric carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, and IL-9 in T cells, which acts as an autocrine growth factor.. EBERs can be secreted from EBV-infected cells and can be detected in the sera of infected patients. RNAs are recognized by toll-like receptor (TLR)3, leading to induction of type-I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines (Iwakiri (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19720839), suggesting that activation of TLR3 signaling could lead to the pathogenesis of active EBV infectious diseases (Iwakiri (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19720839, Iwakiri (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20399962).. Functionality of EBER1 and 2 does not appear to be redundant, as transforming capacity of EBER2-deleted virus is comparable to that of EBV lacking both EBERs, but that of EBER-1-deleted virus is as high as wild-type EBV, indicating that EBER1 does not play a critical role in EBV-induced B-cell growth transformation. (Wu (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17686859)
EBER1 and EBER2 RNAs	None known	Conservation	The primary sequences of EBERs are strongly conserved among EBV strains (Arrand (1989) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2536122).
EBER1 and EBER2 RNAs	None known	Misc	Many similarities with adenovirus VAI and VAII RNAs (Rosa (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9279391), as well as other virus-encoded ncRNAs (eg. Howe (1988) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2839701).
EGO	EGOT	Characteristics	Two isoforms:. ~1.0kb unspliced EGO-A and ~1.5 kb spliced (two exons) EGO-B.. Transcribed antisense from a conserved intron of ITPR1 gene.
EGO	EGOT	Expression	Highly expressed in human bone marrow CD34+ cells and BMMC (bone marrow mononuclear cells).. Highly upregulated during eosinophil development from CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells before returning to basal levels within 72 hours. Despite a return to basal levels, EGO transcripts were present and inducible in mature eosinophils.
EGO	EGOT	Function	Proposed to affect myeloid development by regulating eosinophil gene expression, as knockdown of EGO in vitro in CD34+ cells decreases eosinophil granule protein MBP (major basic protein) and EDN (eosinophil derived neurotoxin) mRNA levels.
EGO	EGOT	Conservation	EGO and some of surrounding sequence is conserved. However the presence of EGO has not been investigated outside of humans. 
EGO	EGOT	Name	Eosinophil granule ontogeny (EGO) RNA
Emx2os	None known	Characteristics	5 kb. Spliced, bi-directional to Emx2, with a 271 nucleotide head-to-head antisense overlap. Riboprobe Northern blot indicates the existence of three additional Emx2os splicing isoforms differentially detected in the murine urogenital system, with sizes of 6.0, 2,3 and 1,8 kb, which are supported by cDNA evidence (Noonan (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573261).
Emx2os	None known	Expression	EMX2 and EMX2OS and their murine orthologs have similar profiles and extensively coincident cellular expression patterns in the endometrium. Expressed in the uterus, abundant in normal postmenopausal endometrium, reduced in premenopausal endometrium (Noonan (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573261).. Emx2os is expressed in the developing mouse CNS. Examination of expression at E10.5, E12.5, E14.5 and E18.5 showed, similar to Emx2, that its levels reduce progressively from E10.5 to E18.5. At E12.5, it is detected in a number of CNS structures also expressing Emx2 mRNA, such as the pallium and basal ganglia, mammillary recess of the hypothalamus, optic tectum, olfactory placode and otic vesicle. Emx2os is found in the developing telencephalon in periventricular proliferative layers and the cortical plate (Spigoni (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053).. However, the sense/antisense pair may also show mutually exclusive patterns, such as within the cortex. Emx2os is detected in periventricular precursors that also express Emx2, but peaks in newly born post-mitotic neurons, which do not express Emx2, whereas Emx2 is expressed Cajal-Retzius neurons lying in the marginal zone, which do not express the antisense RNA (Spigoni (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053).. In human brain, expression has been detected in normal nucleus accumbens (Michelhaugh (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21128942).
Emx2os	None known	Function	EMX2OS is suggested to regulate EMX2 expression (Noonan (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573261), which may involve distinct regulatory mechanisms in different cell types (Spigoni (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053).. In vitro knock-down experiments indicate that Emx2os contributes to post-transcriptional down-regulation of its sense partner in cortical precursors and their neuronal progenies, possibly by a Dicer1-dependent process  (Spigoni (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053).. However, ectopic expression of a 5' fragment (OS1-179+) of Emx2os in neural precursors of the rhombo-spinal tract stimulates expression of Emx2, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism, perhaps at transcriptional level. In addition, Emx2 knock-out results in a strong reduction of Emx2os transcript levels, indicating a possible reciprocal regulatory loop (Spigoni (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053).
Emx2os	None known	Conservation	Association of Emx2os and Emx2 is conserved between mouse and humans, but no sequence conservation was found (Noonan (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573261).
Emx2os	None known	Misc	EMX2OS lies in the minimal interval with allelic loss in endometrial tumors and is a candidate endometrial cancer tumor suppressor (Noonan (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573261).
Emx2os	None known	Name	Emx2os: Emx2 opposite strand transcript.
ENOD40	None known		**Annotation in Progress**
ENOD40	None known	Characteristics	Family of RNAs.. In legumes, it encodes a conserved 10â25 amino acid peptide, and contains up to six inverted repeats (IRs) (Girard et al. 2003).
ENOD40	None known	Expression	***The Enod40 family is expressed in differentiating cells of the primordial nodule (Yang et al. 1993; Crespi et al. 1994), but also has varying levels of expression in all parts of the plant, particularly the vascular system, where its expression correlates with the emergence of lateral roots and emerging leaves (Vleghels et al. 2003, Kouchi et al. 1999, Varkonyi-Gasic and White 2002).***. Expression regulated by growth conditions affecting root tissues  (Campalans (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15037734).
ENOD40	None known	Function	ENOD40 transcripts are required for correct subcellular localization of RNP particles in legume plants (Campalans (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15037734).
ENOD40	None known	Conservation	N/A
ENOD40	None known	Misc	N/A
Evf2	Evf-2, Dlx6as1, Dlx6os1	Characteristics	~3.8 kb. Antisense to Dlx6 genes in the Dlx5/6 cluster. Evf1 and 2 are isoforms with alternative promoters expressed from ultraconserved enhancers. Different Evf-1 and Evf-2 transcripts result from alternative transcription initiation, alternative splicing of exon 3, and alternative polyadenylation. Therefore, Evf-1 and Evf-2 cDNA sequences have unique 5' and 3' ends, and share a 2561bp region of identity (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037, Kohtz (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15183307).. A large (7.5-kb) non-polyadenylated form recognized by both Evf-1 and Evf-2 Northern blot probes is present in the total RNA fraction and absent from the poly(A) containing fraction. The Evf-2-specific probe also identifies a smaller (500-bp) transcript (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037).
Evf2	Evf-2, Dlx6as1, Dlx6os1	Expression	Nuclear localisation (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037, Sone (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623775).. Similar expression pattern to Dlx6 and Dlx5 mRNAs. Developmentally regulated, expressed in the ventral forebrain. Detected in immature neurons as they exit the ventricular zone (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037).. Ectopic expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) induces the expression of Evf-2, Evf-1, Dlx-2, Dlx-5, and Dlx-6 in the dorsal telencephalon in vivo (mouse embryos)  (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037).. Up-regulated in vitro during differentiation of neuronal progenitors to GABAergic neurons and during mouse embryonic stem cells differentiation (Dinger (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562676) (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068). Also found co-expressed in the first and second branchial arches of E10.5 mouse embryos (Jeong (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18697905).. Brain expression of Evf2 and Evf1 is dependent on Dlx1/2 function. Expression of Evf2 and Evf1 is also greatly reduced in Dlx5/6, and Dlx5 or Dlx6, knock-out mutants, indicating that they may be their direct or indirect regulatory targets (Kohtz (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15183307, Jeong (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18697905). Evf1 and Evf2 were more down-regulated in Dlx5-/- than in Dlx6-/- mutants (Jeong (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18697905).
Evf2	Evf-2, Dlx6as1, Dlx6os1	Function	Evf-2 ncRNA and Dlx-2 proten display an intranuclear colocalization (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037).. The ultraconserved region* of Evf-2 binds and co-operates with Dlx-2 in vivo to increase the transcriptional activity of the Dlx-5/6 enhancer in a target and homeodomain-specific manner (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037). *The Evf-2 5' region is both necessary and sufficient for activity.. Evf2 recruitment of DLX2 and MECP2 controls the expression of targets Dlx5, Dlx6 and Gad1 through trans and cis-acting mechanisms in developing ventral forebrain. Evf2 function is also required for proper gene regulation and formation of hippocampal GABA-dependent neuronal circuitry in mouse adult brain (Bond (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19620975).
Evf2	Evf-2, Dlx6as1, Dlx6os1	Conservation	Evf-2 is transcribed from (and contains in its first exon) a vertebrate ultraconserved element. Analysis of transcripts by isolation from a cDNA library (rat), RTâPCR (zebrafish and chicken), or expressed sequence tag (EST) databases (human and mouse) showed that transcription of the ultraconserved element associated with Evf-2 (enhancer ei) is conserved in vertebrates (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037).. Evf-1 and Evf-2 exhibit a high degree (86%â93%) of conservation between rat and mouse sequences in their 5' and 3' regions, and a compilation of transcripts found in human, rat, mouse, zebrafish, and chicken shows that only transcription from exon 2 is conserved (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037).
Evf2	Evf-2, Dlx6as1, Dlx6os1	Misc	Evf-2 is proposed to belong to a class of transcription regulating, ultraconserved ncRNAs (trucRNAs), and may be part of a broader Dlx gene/antisense RNA regulatory network (Feng (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037, Dinger (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562676).
fbp1+ promoter RNAs	None known	Characteristics	LncRNA transcripts from promoter of fbp1+ gene.. Three transcripts A to C.  Expressed in sense direction. Unspliced.. Transcript A initiates furthest upstream from fbp1+ start site, B and C initiate progressively closer to fbp1+. . Although they are transcribed into fbp1+, A-C do not necessarily cover the whole coding sequence and no detectable protein was produced.
fbp1+ promoter RNAs	None known	Expression	Transiently expressed upon glucose starvation before fbp1+ is switched on.. A shows very low constitutive expression and is expressed up to 20 min after glucose starvation. B expressed from 10-60 min, C from 20-60 min. . NB: fbp1+ switches on after 60 min.
fbp1+ promoter RNAs	None known	Function	Transcription of ncRNAs was required for opening of chromatin and activation of fbp1+ transcription.. Progressive movement of transcription from 5' to 3' towards the fbp1+ start site correlates with chromatin remodeling to open up DNA and RNA polymerase II movement.. Termination of upstream transcription prevented chromatin remodeling and fbp1+ induction, showing the necessity of the noncoding cascade in activating transcription.. Unknown if lncRNAs themselves are carrying out a function.
fbp1+ promoter RNAs	None known	Conservation	Identified in fission yeast: Schizosaccharomyces pombe
Frigidair	None known	Characteristics	Transcript on the antisense strand of the HoxC locus between Hoxc4 and Hoxc5 (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780).. LincRNA - Large intervening noncoding RNA.
Frigidair	None known	Expression	Expression is highly anti-correlated with HOTAIR during limb development (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780).. Putatively regulated by NFkB. Amongst lincRNAs differentially expressed after TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) stimulation of CD11C+ bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780).
Frigidair	None known	Misc	Sequence and exact genomic coordinates of the lncRNA have not been defined. 
frq antisense RNAs	None known	Characteristics	2 RNAs of ~5 and ~5.5kb transcribed antisense to the frequency (frq) gene  (Aronson (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8052643, Kramer (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12607002).. Antisense transcription initiates at several sites (217, 241 and 278bp) downstream of the frq sense stop codon (Kramer (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12607002).
frq antisense RNAs	None known	Expression	Antisense RNA showed a cyclic expression pattern but with the opposite rhythm to frq sense RNA and at a lower expression level when Neurospora was grown in the dark (Kramer (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12607002).. Strongly up-regulated when cells exposed to light (as is frq sense) (Kramer (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12607002).
frq antisense RNAs	None known	Function	Required for entrainment of the circadian clock in Neurospora crassa (Kramer (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12607002).. Loss of antisense transcript altered circadian rhythms with the clock set several hours earlier than normal and causing delayed onset of rhythmic conidiation (spore production) (Kramer (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12607002).. Antisense transcripts were also necessary for proper clock resetting on exposure to light. In the wild type light exposure caused a small resetting of the clock, while loss of antisense transcripts caused a massive resetting of the clock (Kramer (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12607002).
frq antisense RNAs	None known	Misc	Cyclic expression of the the sense frequency RNA (and frq protein) is required for Neurospora circadian timing.
G22	None known	Characteristics	~280 nucleotides, dimeric Alu sequence (Kuryshev (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11399078).. Same genetic locus has been targeted independently to create Alu derived BC200 and G22 genes in different primate lineages (Kuryshev (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11399078, Ludwig (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15922354). 
G22	None known	Conservation	Found in strepsirhini primates (Lemurs and Lorises) (Kuryshev (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11399078). However, G22 appears under selection only in lorisiformes (Galago moholi) (Ludwig (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15922354).. BC200, BC1 and G22 likely form a family of independently exapted repetitive elements which have evolved to carry out similar functions in different mammalian species (Muddashetty (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162957, Khanam (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17175535).
G22	None known	Function	Binds to poly(A) binding protein (PABP) and the SRP9/14 heterodimer (Khanam (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17175535).
G22	None known	Expression	Transcribed in lorisiform brain (Ludwig (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15922354).. Localised to dendrites in a transgenic mouse (Khanam (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17175535).  
G22	None known	Misc	Galago moholi G22 can be found in REGION: 8494..8776 of  AF314807.. L13, (version in lemurs) can be found in REGION: 6983..7295 of AF314807. 
Gadd7	adapt15	Characteristics	Gene involved in the cellular response to a number of stressors.. 754 nt (Hollander (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8649973).
Gadd7	adapt15	Expression	Induced by DNA damage (Hollander (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8649973), lipotoxic-stress (Brookheart (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19150982), non-lipid oxidative stress (ie hydrogen peroxide exposure) (Crawford (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8561505, Crawford (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8638945), serum starvation (Hollander (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8649973, Crawford (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8638945) and heat shock (Crawford (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8638945).
Gadd7	adapt15	Function	Regulation of lipid-induced oxidative and ER stress (Brookheart (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19150982).. Causes growth arrest and cell death (Hollander (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8649973, Brookheart (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19150982). . Found in cytoplasm associated with active ribosomes (Crawford (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8561505), however all attempts at in-vitro and in-vivo translation have failed to express any peptides from the short ORFs found in the sequence (Crawford (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8561505, Hollander (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8649973, Brookheart (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19150982). Suggests ribosomal association could be regulatory, though translation of gadd7 can't be completely ruled out. . Induction by hydrogen peroxide required calcium (Crawford (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8638945). 
Gadd7	adapt15	Conservation	Identified in hamster.
GAL10-ncRNA		Characteristics	GAL10-ncRNA runs antisense through the GAL10 gene, through the bidirectional GAL1-10 promoter and through to the 3â of GAL1 gene in the sense direction. 4kb transcript.. Transcripts are 5â capped and 3â polyadenylated.
GAL10-ncRNA		Expression	Under non-induced and repressed conditions, marks of active transcription (H3 K4 me2/me3) are not present at GAL protein coding gene promoters but instead found at 3â end of GAL10. Histone modifications require binding of Reb1.. Reb1 drives expression of ncRNAs under repressive, and non-induced nutrient conditions. GAL10-ncRNA was the 4kb major transcript but also a weaker 2.3kb transcript is also present. All characterisation was on the 4kb GAL10-ncRNA.. GAL10-ncRNA stability was tested, half life ~8 min (relatively stable for a yeast transcript) and targeted for degredation by the TRAMP / exosome complexes.. Steady state expression level ~0.07 transcripts per cell / ~ 1 transcript per 14 cells. . Estimate ncRNA transcribed once every 50 minutes.
GAL10-ncRNA		Function	Summary: GAL10-ncRNA enhances repression of GAL10 and GAL1 expression when yeast are growing in repressive nutrient conditions.. Transcription of GAL10 ncRNA causes changes in chromatin. . - H3 K36 me3 is deposited over the chromosomal region GAL10-ncRNA is transcribed from.. - GAL10 transcription also causes a decrease in some histone 3 acetlyation.. GAL10 ncRNA acts in cis, recruiting the Rpd3S HDAC complex. Unknown if GAL10 ncRNA can physically recruit any chromatin modifying complexes or if transcription dependent chromatin changes independent of the GAL10-ncRNA sequence are responsible.. Note: this is not a transcriptional interference mechanism (see infrequent GAL10-ncRNA trancription) but a chromatin modification mechanism.
GAL10-ncRNA		Misc	GAL cluster of 3 genes (GAL1, GAL7, GAL10) are involved in galactose metabolism. Yeast has complex regulation of nutrient metabolism genes and the cluster can be induced, non-induced or repressed depending on the carbon sources available.
GAS5	SNHG2	Characteristics	Growth arrest-specific transcript (Schneider (1988) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3409319), multiple splice isoforms (Coccia (1992) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1630459) of ~250, ~450, ~600nuc and longer (Mourtada-Maarabouni (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18354083), encodes 9 (10 in humans) snoRNAs in its introns (Smith (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9819378).
GAS5	SNHG2	Expression	Widely expressed in adult tissues and over embryonic development (Coccia (1992) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1630459).. Transcript undergoes post-transcriptional regulation, highly unstable but stabilised by growth arrest, serum starvation and inhibition of protein synthesis (Coccia (1992) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1630459, Smith (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9819378, Kino (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551). Associates with ribosomes in the cytoplasm (Smith (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9819378).. Localises to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Kino (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551).. Down-regulated in breast cancer (Mourtada-Maarabouni (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18836484).. Transcript was classified as unstable with a half-life >4 hr in human Hela cells (Tani (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369889). Similar half-lives were identified in human B cells and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
GAS5	SNHG2	Function	Necessary and sufficient for growth arrest in human peripheral blood T-cells. Functions by  controlling apoptosis and the cell cycle in lymphocytes (Mourtada-Maarabouni (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18354083).. In some cell lines certain Gas5 isoforms act to sensitise the cells to apoptosis but can't induce apoptosis on their own. In other cells types Gas5 can both induce apoptosis and growth arrest and sensitise the cells to further apoptosis (Mourtada-Maarabouni (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18836484).. Gas5 can be regulated by mTOR, with mTOR (which promotes cellular proliferation) acting to inhibit the function of Gas5 (Mourtada-Maarabouni (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20421347).. Gas5 carries out its function by binding the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with a sequence that mimmics the glucocorticoid response element (GRE). Gas5 is translocated into the nucleus bound to the GR where it prevents GR from binding GREs and regulating transcription of target genes including apoptosis inhibitors (Kino (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551).. Gas5 also appears to repress the action of many steroid hormone receptors, showing some similarities to another lncRNA SRA (Kino (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551).. Gas5 is a snoRNA host and a functional RNA. Function does not require putative but nonconserved ORF, or the intronic snoRNAs (Mourtada-Maarabouni (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18354083, Mourtada-Maarabouni (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18836484, Kino (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551).
GAS5	SNHG2	Conservation	Gas5 in mouse and human do not show high sequence identity (Tanaka-Fujita (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468437) although the GRE mimmic region is conserved (Kino (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551).. Most of the snoRNAs found in human Gas5 also cluster in the same order in a putatively noncoding RNA host gene in chicken. 42% homology was found between human Gas5 and the chicken gene which was named Gas5-like (Shao (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19232134).
GAS5	SNHG2	Misc	Mourtada-Maarabouni., et al (2010) provide an interesting hypothesis for how Gas5 levels and therefore function is regulated.. - Gas5 is stabilised by inhibition of protein synthesis suggesting it may normally be a target for nonsense mediated decay (NMD). mTOR regulates 5' TOP genes (which includes Gas5) promoting translation, whereas mTOR inhibition inhibits translation. This could allow mTOR to inhibit Gas5 by promoting Gas5 NMD. . This suggests that since Gas5 is known to be functional at the RNA level, any Gas5 translation may be a regulatory to control Gas5 levels and not necessarily to produce a functional protein.  
Gomafu	MIAT, RNCR2	Characteristics 	Intergenic, ~9-10kb alternatively spliced transcript in mammals (Ishii (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17066261, Sone (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623775).. Contains tandem UACUAAC repeats, which match the conserved intron branch point sequence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tsuiji (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463453).
Gomafu	MIAT, RNCR2	Expression	Expressed predominantly in the nervous system (Ishii (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17066261, Sone (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623775, Mercer (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18184812, Tsuiji (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463453).. Shows dynamic regulation during retinal development (Blackshaw (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823), differentiation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068) and in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation (Sheik Mohamed (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20026622)(Dinger (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562676). . Expressed in the nucleus accumbens of normal human brains and one of a few genes up-regulated in this brain region in both cocaine and heroin abusers (Albertson (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16710320, Michelhaugh (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21128942).. Nuclear specific localisation to novel nuclear matrix subdomain (Sone (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623775).
Gomafu	MIAT, RNCR2	Function	Gomafu can bind the splicing factor 1 (SF1) protein through its UACUAAC repeat sequences. This sequence is a much stronger intron branch point sequence than found in most mammalian introns. In-vitro Gomafu binding to SF1 can inhibit splicing and spliceosomal complex formation suggesting Gomafu can function to regulate splicing efficiency (Tsuiji (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463453).. Regulates retinal cell fate specification (Rapicavoli (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20459797).. Variants confer susceptibility to myocardial infarction, possibly through altering the RNA's protein binding properties (Ishii (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17066261).. Probable target of transcription factor Oct4 in mESCs. Appears to maintain Oct4 expression in a feedback loop helping to maintain pluripotency (Sheik Mohamed (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20026622).  
Gomafu	MIAT, RNCR2	Conservation	Well conserved in placental mammals, present in chicken and appears to be conserved back to amphibians (Rapicavoli (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20459797, Tsuiji (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463453).  . Outside of mammals sequence conservation is low but the SF1 binding UACUAAC repeats are conserved (Rapicavoli (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20459797, Tsuiji (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463453).
Gomafu	MIAT, RNCR2	Names	MIAT: myocardial infarction associated transcript (Ishii (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17066261).. RNCR2: retinal noncoding RNA 2 (Blackshaw (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823).
Gtl2-as	Gtl2 antisense, Meg3-as	Characteristics	Northern suggests a transcript of around 3kb.. Transcript initiation and termination sites not defined, however at least some of transcript is located between Rtl1 and Meg3/Gtl2.
Gtl2-as	Gtl2 antisense, Meg3-as	Expression	Identified in mouse embyonic stem cells (mESCs)
Gtl2-as	Gtl2 antisense, Meg3-as	Function	Binds PRC2 chromatin modifying complex
Gtl2-as	Gtl2 antisense, Meg3-as	Misc	As the transcript itself is not defined no accurate ucsc browser link is possible.
H19	None known	Characteristics	2.3 kb. Imprinted at the Igf2 locus (Bartolomei (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1709450, Zemel (1992) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1303252).. Also contains a microRNA (miR-675) in exon one (Cai (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237358).
H19	None known	Expression	Expressed from the maternal allele, while the neighbouring Igf2 gene is transcribed from the paternal allele (Bartolomei (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1709450). . In mice, H19 is activated in extra-embryonic cell types at the time of implantation. Strongly expressed during embryogenesis, down-regulated after birth with strong expression only retained in skeletal muscle and cartilage (Pachnis (1984) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6206499, Pachnis (1988) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3396539, Poirier (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1811930, Castle (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668672, Dudek (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20529846); upregulated in various tumors (Matouk (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17786216).. Can be found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Runge (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10875929, Schoenfelder (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17948025, Brannan (1990) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1688465). 
H19	None known	Function	Complex functions: . Influences growth via control of Igf2 expression, with a H19 knockout showing an overgrowth phenotype due in part to bi-allelic expression of Igf2 (Ripoche (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9203585).. Can also function in trans to downregulate the expression of a number of imprinted genes in the hypothesised Imprinted Gene Network (IGN) including Igf2r, Dlk1 etc. Allowing H19 to regulate growth during development (Gabory (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19762426).. Implicated as both a tumor suppressor (Hao (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7692308, Yoshimizu (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18719115) and an oncogene upregulated by c-myc and hypoxia (Matouk (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17786216, Barsyte-Lovejoy (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16707459 and references therein). A number of reports have also shown upregulation / reactivation of H19 in various cancers although the functional significance (if any) is unclear in many cases (Gabory (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20486133, Adriaenssens (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9811352).. The mode of action by which H19 functions is still unclear: . Focusing on its regulation of Igf2, H19 has been hypothesised to act at the level of transcription since an H19 knockout lead to methylation changes and loss of imprinting of Igf2 (Ripoche (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9203585, FornÃ© (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9294195). However, H19 can bind Igf2 mRNA binding-protein (IMP) family members (Runge (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10875929), which appear to act to promote translation of Igf2 (Hansen (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15121863, Liao (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15753088), therefore competition between Igf2 and H19 for IMP1 binding may allow H19 to regulate Igf2 post-transcriptionally.. Both sense and antisense transcripts from the H19 locus were identified as binding to the PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting a potential function for H19 RNA (Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659).. miR-675 may be responsible for the oncogenic activity of H19 as it was found to down-regulate the tumour suppressor retinoblastoma (RB) in human colorectal cancer, causing increased tumour cell growth (Tsang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19926638). Also, in adult human chondrocytes, expression of H19 (and subsequently miR-675) is driven by SOX9 with miR-675 acting to positively regulate COL2A1 which encodes a collagen protein important to the cartilage matrix (Dudek (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20529846).. H19 appears to be a bi-functional RNA acting as both a miRNA and a lncRNA. Such properties may help to explain the conflicting reports that it is both a tumour suppressor and an oncogene (Smits (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587395). Additionally its effect on tumour development may be heavily context dependent (Gabory (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20486133). 
H19	None known	Conservation	Conserved and imprinted in therians (eutherians and marsupials). Both the miRNA and the  H19 lncRNA exon structure are conserved (Smits (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587395).
H19	None known	Misc	First long noncoding RNA described in mammalian cells (Brannan (1990) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1688465). Gabory 2010 provides a useful review of some of the extensive literature on H19 (Gabory (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20486133).
H19 antisense	91H	Characteristics	Expression identified upstream and downstream of H19 including through H19 enhancers and imprinting control region (ICR) in cancer cell lines (Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369). . Suggested to be an antisense transcript covering ~120kb which starts in intron 1 of the (non-imprinted) MRPL23 gene and runs through H19 towards Igf2. A full length clone has not been identified so the presence of splicing is unknown. Transcript hypothesised to cover much of MRPL23 in sense direction as well as the H19 enhancers and ICR plus H19 in the antisense direction (Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369).
H19 antisense	91H	Expression	Transcript appears to be nuclear and highly unstable. It is lowly expressed in normal cells with up-regulation in cancer cells due to transcript stabilisation (Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369).. Antisense transcription throughout locus was also identified in mouse (Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369).. Imprinted: Maternally expressed (Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369).
H19 antisense	91H	Function	Knockdown lead to a decrease in Igf2 expression. Knockdown had little effect on H19 expression (Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369) and it is unclear if it affected expression of H19 enhancers or the ICR.
H19 antisense	91H	Conservation	Mouse and human (Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369).
H19 antisense	91H	Misc	It is difficult to define the independent transcripts throughout this locus since enhancer and ICR sequences are known to be transcribed, sometimes bi-allelically (Drewell (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11874916, Schoenfelder (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17948025).  . Question of whether a 120kb unspliced antisense transcript exists in that form, or if there are a mixture of antisense transcripts throughout this loci or both. . Note that at least one protein coding gene has now been identified antisense to H19 (Onyango (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21940503), although its genomic location is only a small segment of the genomic region H19 antisense is hypothesized to cover.
H19 ICR ncRNAs	None known	Expression	Nuclear localised sense and antisense transcripts were expressed from the ICR. Transcripts came from both maternal and paternal alleles (Drewell (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11874916, Schoenfelder (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17948025).. Berteaux 08 also reported bi-allelic expression from the ICR region (Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369). 
H19 ICR ncRNAs	None known	Function	In a transgenic Drosophila system H19 ICR ncRNAs were necessary to silence a reporter gene, indicating that they may regulate imprinting of the Igf2 locus (Schoenfelder (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17948025).
H19 ICR ncRNAs	None known	Name	H19 imprinting control region (ICR) noncoding RNAs
H19 ICR ncRNAs	None known	Conservation	Mouse and human (Schoenfelder (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17948025, Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369).
H19 ICR ncRNAs	None known	Misc	Sequence and precise genome location of the transcripts have not been defined.
H19 upstream conserved 1 & 2	Huc 1 & 2	Characteristics	Huc 1 & 2 are ~400bp conserved DNA elements separated by 1.4kb found ~10kb 5' of the H19 gene and the H19 ICR.. Both Huc 1 & 2 are transcribed producing individual transcripts which do not appear to join or overlap. 
H19 upstream conserved 1 & 2	Huc 1 & 2	Expression	Huc1 and 2 were bi-allelically expressed as individual transcripts in same orientation as H19.. Expressed in a range of tissues in mid-gestation embryos, with only partial overlap to H19. No sign of antisense transcription as reported by Berteaux (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794369 at this locus.
H19 upstream conserved 1 & 2	Huc 1 & 2	Function	Huc1 & 2 acted as strong mesodermal enhancers in a transgenic enhancer assay. Likely drive mesodermal expression of H19.. Contribution of expressed RNAs to Huc enhancer function is unknown.
H19 upstream conserved 1 & 2	Huc 1 & 2	Conservation	Mice and humans.
H19 upstream conserved 1 & 2	Huc 1 & 2	Name	Huc: H19 upstream conserved
H19 upstream conserved 1 & 2	Huc 1 & 2	Misc	Sequence and precise genome location of the transcripts have not been defined.
HAR1A	HAR1F 	Characteristics	~2.8kb, spliced 2 exon transcript. Contains a 'human accelerated region' (HAR). Overlaps with an antisense noncoding RNA, HAR1B - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Default.aspx?TKeyid=232 (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).. Conserved HAR1 sequence (common to both HAR1A and HAR1B) forms a secondary structure which is highly conserved (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236) but has undergone changes from a hairpin structure in chimps to a cloverleaf structure in humans (Beniaminov (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511501).
HAR1A	HAR1F 	Expression	Expressed in adult brain and during cortical development (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236). . Expressed in Cajal-Retzius neurons in the neocortex during early to mid-gestation (7-9 to 17-19 weeks) in humans and macaques (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).  . During mid-gestation expressed in developing hippocampus, dentate gyrus and cerebellar cortex in human. Expression was found in adult brain, ovary and testis (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).. Repressed transcriptionally by REST, which causes repression of HAR1A in the striatum of Huntington's disease patients (Johnson (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20179156). . The overlapping antisense RNA (HAR1B - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Default.aspx?TKeyid=232) is also expressed in adult brain (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).. In mouse, locus is expressed during embryonic development (peak at E15) and in adults it is specifically expressed in the brain (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).
HAR1A	HAR1F 	Conservation	Contains a 'human accelerated region', which is a sequence highly conserved in amniotes (negative selection) but which has evolved rapidly in the human lineage (positive selection) since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees from the last common ancestor (18 bases out of 118 are different between human and chimpanzee but only 2 differences between chimpanzee and chicken) (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).. HAR1A has orthologues in a number of closely mammals but in mouse and more distantly related species only the HAR1 sequence is conserved (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).
HAR1B	HAR1R	Characteristics	~900bp in humans. Contains a 'human accelerated region' (HAR). Overlaps with an antisense noncoding RNA, HAR1A - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Default.aspx?TKeyid=95 (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).. Two splice isoforms, one with 2 exons, one with 3 exons (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).. Conserved HAR1 sequence (common to both HAR1A and HAR1B) forms a secondary structure which is highly conserved (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236) but has undergone changes from a hairpin structure in chimps to a cloverleaf structure in humans (Beniaminov (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511501).
HAR1B	HAR1R	Expression	Expression was found in adult brain, ovary and testis in human. Expression level was much lower than HAR1A - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Default.aspx?TKeyid=95 (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).. Repressed transcriptionally by REST, which causes repression of HAR1B in striatum of Huntington's disease patients (Johnson (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20179156).   . The mouse locus is expressed during embryonic development (peak at E15) and in adults it is specifically expressed in the brain. Unlike in human, "HAR1B" was expressed at similar levels to "HAR1A" in mouse (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).
HAR1B	HAR1R	Conservation	Contains a 'human accelerated region', which is a sequence highly conserved in amniotes (negative selection) but which has evolved rapidly in the human lineage (positive selection) since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees from the last common ancestor (18 bases out of 118 are different between human and chimpanzee but only 2 differences between chimpanzee and chicken) (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).. Rest of HAR1B sequence has little conservation outside of chimp and macaque (Pollard (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915236).
HOTAIR	Gm16258	Characteristics	2.2 kb; spliced, polyadenylated and comprised of 6 exons in humans (Rinn (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604720). . Transcribed from the HOXC locus from a position intergenic and antisense to the flanking HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes (Rinn (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604720).
HOTAIR	Gm16258	Expression	Expressed in posterior and distal fibroblasts (Rinn (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604720).. Expression level in cancer is an efficient predictor of metastasis and survival with high expression levels predictive of poor outcomes (Gupta (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393566). Also in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC), HOTAIR expression levels were higher in cancerous tissues than in noncancerous tissues, with high HOTAIR expression tightly correlated with the presence of liver metastasis and associated with poor prognosis (Kogo (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21862635) .. Some HOTAIR transcripts localise to the nucleus (Khalil (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571010).. In situ hybridization analysis of the mouse cognate RNA (mHotair) showed expression similar to Hoxc11, with distinct levels in parts of the proximal hindlimbs, genital bud and tail in embryos at E11.5, as well as in in posterior part of the hindlimb and genital bud at E12.5 (Schorderet (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21637793). . Transcript found to be quite unstable with a half-life >4 hr in human Hela cells (Tani (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369889). 
HOTAIR	Gm16258	Function	Originally identified as silencing the HoxD locus but has since been found to epigenetic silence gene expression at many sites across the genome by recruitment of PRC2 and LSD1/CoREST/REST repressive chromatin modifying complexes (Rinn (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604720, Tsai (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20616235).. HOTAIR acts as a scaffold for protein complexes. A 5' domain binds PRC2 while a 3' domain binds LSD1 (Tsai (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20616235).. Oncogene - regulates metastatic progression (Gupta (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393566)(Schorderet (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21637793).. HOTAIR dysregulated in breast cancer with frequent overexpression in metastases. . Overexpression of HOTAIR leads to PRC2 re-targeting across the genome to a state similar to that in embryonic fibroblasts, promoting tumour invasion and metatasis.  Oncogenic effects of HOTAIR upregulation were dependent on PRC2 (Gupta (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393566).. Deletion of the HoxC cluster containing the cognate Hotair transcript in mouse showed little phenotypic effect, with little change in the expression on levels of H3K27me3 coverage in corresponding human HOTAIR Hoxd target genes (Schorderet (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21637793).
HOTAIR	Gm16258	Conservation	HOTAIR exists in mammals but with poor sequence conservation (Rinn (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604720)(He (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21496275). A 239 bp domain in HOTAIR exon 6 is especially conserved in mammals (He (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21496275).. The mouse EST (AK035706) homologous to human HOTAIR is comprised of two exons only, with the second half of the first exon showing similarity to exon 4 of HOTAIR, whereas the second exon is homologous to exon 6 of HOTAIR (Schorderet (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21637793). This may underlie differences in function since the first three exons of HOTAIR (absent from mHotair) contain binding sites for EZH2, while the 3' extremity of human HOTAIR that interact with LSD1 is part of the least conserved DNA sequence within mHotair exon 2 (Schorderet (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21637793).
HOTAIR	Gm16258	Name	Hox antisense intergenic RNA
HOTAIRM1	HIT06113, HIT92376, linc1548	Characteristics	Bidirectional transcript with HoxA1. Located between HOXA1 and HOXA2 genes (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766, Zhang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144990).. Identified transcript is 483 nt (Zhang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144990) but other splice isoforms are also likely to be expressed.
HOTAIRM1	HIT06113, HIT92376, linc1548	Expression	Expressed in the myeloid lineage (Zhang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144990). Has also been identified as showing a similar expression pattern to HoxA1 and A2 with expression in thymus, muscle, colon, lung, kidney, spleen etc (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).. Induced by retinoic acid (RA) (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Zhang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144990).. Shows collinear regulation of expression like HOX PTC genes (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360).. Expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018)
HOTAIRM1	HIT06113, HIT92376, linc1548	Function	HOTAIRM plays a role in the regulation of gene expression during RA-induced myeloid differentiation (Zhang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144990). Knock-down of HOTAIRM prevented induction of HOXA1 and HOXA4 expression during myeloid differentiation as well as the induction of myeloid differentiation genes CD11b and CD18 (Zhang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144990).. Found to interact with a number of of chromatin binding proteins/complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells including PRC1, PRC2 and CBX1 (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018).
HOTAIRM1	HIT06113, HIT92376, linc1548	Conservation	Sequence quite highly conserved in mammals, with transcripts also detected in mouse and rat (Zhang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144990). 
HOTAIRM1	HIT06113, HIT92376, linc1548	Name	HOTAIRM1: HOX antisense intergenic RNA myeloid 1
HOTTIP	HOXA13as, HIT18844, NCRNA00213	Characteristics	Gene located at 5â end of HoxA cluster, bidirectional transcript with HOXA13 (Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).. ~3.8kb, transcript in human, spliced and polyadenylated (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168).. ~2.3kb transcript in mouse, different splice isoforms, currently known transcripts initiate downstream from the syntenic site in human. 
HOTTIP	HOXA13as, HIT18844, NCRNA00213	Expression	Shows collinear regulation of expression like HOX protein coding genes (Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).. Has bivalent chromatin marks (both H3 K4me3 and H3 K27me3) whether expression off or on, but only expressed in more distal cells (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168).. Has a similar expression profile to HOXA13, expressed in colon, prostate, placenta and uterus, as well as hand, foreskin and foot fibroblasts (Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17451645, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766, Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168). Mouse E13.5 in-situs gave similar results (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168).. Nuclear localised, generally to a single small nuclear spot (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168).. Lowly expressed, estimated at ~0.3 copies/cell in expressing tissues (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168).
HOTTIP	HOXA13as, HIT18844, NCRNA00213	Conservation	Present in human and mouse. Portions of HOXA13as sequence are well conserved throughout mammals (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168). . Appears to be present in chicken although there is little homology (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168).. RNA contains some highly conserved sequences which are predicted to form a conserved structure (Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).
HOTTIP	HOXA13as, HIT18844, NCRNA00213	Misc	Background: Hox genes are found in 4 clusters. Genes in each cluster are expressed in certain tissues along body axes dependent on their position in the cluster. In the HoxA cluster genes near the 5â are expressed in more distal tissues while genes near the 3â are expressed in more proximal tissues.. Expressed genes have active chromatin marks and show close physical association (likely due to chromosomal looping). Inactive genes do not associate and have repressive chromatin marks (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168).. Human clone accession: GU724873. Mouse clone accession: BC046496
HOTTIP	HOXA13as, HIT18844, NCRNA00213	Function	Summary:. Controls activation of 5â HOXA genes. Chromosomal lopping bring it into close association with 5â gene loci. HOTTIP binds WDR5 and recruits a MLL chromatin modifiying complex to maintain a domain of active chromatin over the 5â of HOXA cluster (Wang (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423168). . - HOTTIP controls activation of 5â HOXA genes in mammals and chicken. . - Impact on HOXA genes decreases with increased genomic distance from HOTTIP.. - Phenotypic impact in chicken forelimb of HOTTIP knockdown was shorter than normal distal bones. . - HOTTIP doesnât affect chromosomal structure and looping but it was necessary for maintenance of H3 K4me3 chromatin marks over the distally expressed 5â half of the HOXA locus. HOTTIP RNA binds WDR5 a component of MLL/Trithorax complexes recruiting a MLL complex to lay down H3 K4me3 marks.. - WDR5 binding mediated by sequence(s) in 5â 1kb of HOTTIP. . HOTTIP appears to act in cis, its function is facilitated by the chromosomal looping that brings it into close proximity with 5â HOXA genes. 
HOTTIP	HOXA13as, HIT18844, NCRNA00213	Name	HOTTIP - HOXA transcript at the distal tip
Hoxa11as	Hoxa11s, Hoxa11os, NCRNA00076	Characteristics	Bidirectional promoter with HOXA11. Multiple splice isoforms are present which share a common 3' exon (Hsieh-Li (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7789268, Potter (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9745033), only some overlap HOXA11 (Potter (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9745033).. Annotated human isoform is ~1.6kb. A number of isoforms including ~1.4, ~1.9, ~2.9 and ~3.2kb transcripts have been identified in mouse (Hsieh-Li (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7789268).
Hoxa11as	Hoxa11s, Hoxa11os, NCRNA00076	Expression	More highly expressed than HOXA11 in mouse development (Hsieh-Li (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7789268).. Expressed in developing limbs where it showed a complementary expression pattern to HOXA11 (Hsieh-Li (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7789268). Also expressed in fetal kidney (Potter (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9745033),  placenta, adult colon, muscle and prostate (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766). Shows collinear regulation of expression like HOX PTC genes (Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).. Expressed in same cell types as HOXA11 in the uterus. HOXA11as was dynamically expressed in the uterus during the menstrual cycle, with a peak in the endometrial late-proliferative phase, showing a pattern inverse to HOXA11 (Chau (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12050232). . HOXA11as levels were down-regulated by progesterone in primary uterine stromal cells, which correlated with HOXA11 up-regulation in the same cells (Chau (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12050232). 
Hoxa11as	Hoxa11s, Hoxa11os, NCRNA00076	Function	Due to the inverse or complementary expression pattern between Hoxa11 and HOXA11as mRNA expression levels, in the developing limbs (Hsieh-Li (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7789268) and adult endometrium (Chau (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12050232), HOXA11as has been proposed to negatively regulate Hoxa11 mRNA levels (Chau (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12050232).
Hoxa11as	Hoxa11s, Hoxa11os, NCRNA00076	Conservation	Sequence highly conserved (Potter (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9745033), found throughout mammals.
Hoxa11as	Hoxa11s, Hoxa11os, NCRNA00076	Misc	Some HOXA11as isoforms have long ORFs, however these ORFs are not conserved between human and mouse (despite high nucleotide sequence conservation) (Hsieh-Li (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7789268, Potter (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9745033). So while HOXA11as is thought to be noncoding, a possible role for HOXA11as encoding a protein cannot be completely discounted.
HOXA3as	HIT12844, HIT94153	Characteristics	Antisense to the long isoform of HOXA3 and to the 3' end of HOXA4 (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).. Several spliced, overlapping, transcripts are present at this locus (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).
HOXA3as	HIT12844, HIT94153	Expression	Various antisense transcripts show similar expression profiles to each other and to HOXA3 and HOXA4. Expressed in the lung, kidney and testis (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).. Expression can be induced by retinoic acid (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360).. Shows collinear regulation of expression like HOX PTC genes (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).
HOXA3as	HIT12844, HIT94153	Conservation	Antisense transcripts to HoxA3 and HoxA4 also exist in mouse but unclear if they are homologous.
HOXA3as	HIT12844, HIT94153	Misc	Example accession is: BC035889
HOXA6as	HIT16800	Characteristics	Multiple spliced transcripts between HoxA6 and HOXA7 on the antisense strand, share some splice junctions but have different 5' and 3' ends (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).  .  . Some HOX6as transcripts overlap to one or both HOX protein coding genes (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).
HOXA6as	HIT16800	Expression	Expressed in adult lung, kidney, testis, placenta, colon, muscle. Fetal ovary and kidney, similar to HOXA6 and HOXA7 (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).. Expression can be induced by retinoic acid (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360).. Shows collinear regulation of expression like HOX PTC genes (Sessa (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185360, Sasaki (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445766).
HOXA6as	HIT16800	Misc	Example accessions: AK091933, AK092154.
HOXA6as	HIT16800	Conservation	HOXA6as transcripts contain sequences conserved in mammals and even sequences ultra conserved in vertebrates.. Similar mouse transcripts are not known, however, transcripts which run antisense to both HOXA5 and HOXA6, that share an splice junction with HOXA6as and transcribe through the vertebrate conserved element, are present in both species. 
Hoxd3as	Dxoh-3, Hoxd3os	Characteristics	Spliced antisense transcript. Northern identified transcripts of 2.8 and 1.5kb.. Partial cDNA clone started 3' of Hoxd3, contained homeobox in antisense direction and continued into the Hoxd3 intron.

Hoxd3as	Dxoh-3, Hoxd3os	Misc	Sequence and precise genome location of the transcripts have not been defined.
hsr omega transcripts	hsr(omega) RNA, omega1-3 RNAs		hsr omega: heat shock RNA omega
hsr omega transcripts	hsr(omega) RNA, omega1-3 RNAs	Characteristics	Product of the 93D (or hsr-omega) locus, one of the largest heat-shock puffs in Drosophila polytene chromosomes. This locus produces three major long transcripts (by alternative polyadenylation and splicing) in all Drosophila species examined (reviewed in Jolly (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17020918). The locus spans 10â20 kb, composed of two small exons (~475 and 700 bp in Drosophila melanogaster) separated by a 700 bp intron, and followed by a long stretch (5â15 kb) of short (280 bp in D. melanogaster) tandem repeat units (Jolly (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17020918).. Long noncoding transcripts produced include three major hsr-omega transcripts, which share the same 5' end (Bendena (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1704862, Garbe (1986) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3097014):. Hsr-omega-n (omega-1) is >10kb-long and nuclear transcript that covers the entire length of the gene (including the tandem repeats), is polyadenylated, and retains the intron.. Hsr-omega-c (omega-3 ) is 1.2-kb, spliced and cytoplasmic. . The third common RNA, omega-pre-c (omega-2) is spliced to produce the mature omega-c transcript. It is 1.9kb-long and terminates at a first polyadenylation site located at the 3' end of exon 2.
hsr omega transcripts	hsr(omega) RNA, omega1-3 RNAs	Expression	Transcripts are constitutively expressed at relatively high levels in many tissues, in almost all cell types analysed, and are developmentally regulated (Lakhotia (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11255511)(Bendena (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1704862)(Mutsuddi (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8641048).. Transcripts were not detected in gonadal cell types such as male and female gonial cells and in follicle cells and oocytes in ovary. Polytenised tissues such as salivary glands, and certain regions of larval gut and the Malpighian tubules, showed a greater abundance of hsr-omega transcripts with a strong hybridization in nuclei (Bendena (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1704862). . Expression is stress-induced, being highly active after heat exposure, but also responsive to other stresses such as amides benzamide and colchicine (Tapadia (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9364937).. Nuclear hsr-omega-n is localized in nuclear granules called omega-speckles (Sengupta (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114940, Bendena (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1704862, Prasanth (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10984439).
hsr omega transcripts	hsr(omega) RNA, omega1-3 RNAs	Function	Flies null for Hsr-omega mostly die at embryonic stage, and the surviving flies are weak, sterile and die within a few days of emergence (Jolly (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17020918).. Transcribed from a locus involved in the heat shock response in Drosophila. hsr-omega-n nuclear transcripts form complexes with various hnRNP proteins and related proteins in nucleoplasmic omega-speckles, distributed in the interchromatin space in close proximity to the chromatin (Sengupta (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114940, Bendena (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1704862, Prasanth (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10984439).. Many proteins are found associated with the hsr-omega-n transcripts, including: (i) various hnRNPs Hrp40 (hnRNP A), Hrb87F (hnRNP A1/A2), Hrb57A (hnRNP K), Hrb98DE (44); (ii) other nuclear RNA-binding proteins like NonA, PEP, Sxl, nuclear non-histone proteins recognized by Q14, Q16, T29, P75 antibodies; (iii) Snf; (iv) Hsp83 and (v) Tpr (see Jolly (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17020918 for review and references).. Omega speckles disappear after heat shock, except from the hsr-omega/93D locus, and speckled distribution of associated hnRNPs is disrupted in hsr-omega nullosomics (Prasanth (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10984439). It is suggested that the ncRNA may regulate the availability of hnRNPs in active (chromatin bound) and inactive (in omega-speckles) compartments and interfere with the processing of pre-mRNAs in cyst cells (Rajendra (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11910129).. Altered expression of the hsr omega RNAs enhances poly-Q-induced neurotoxicity in Drosophila (Sengupta (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114940, Mallik (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19667761, Fernandez-Funez (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11081516).
hsr omega transcripts	hsr(omega) RNA, omega1-3 RNAs	Conservation	The hsr-omega/93D locus and genomic organization is conserved among Drosophila species. However, the hsr-omega transcripts have poor sequence conservation among different Drosophila species (Garbe (1986) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3097014), but, similar to other ncRNAs, have short stretches of conservation.
hsr omega transcripts	hsr(omega) RNA, omega1-3 RNAs	Misc	Heat shock puffs in Chironomus genus also produce non-conding transcripts analogous to Drosophila  hsr omega transcripts, and interaction of Hsp90 with puffs is dependent on transcription (Morcillo (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8306827). Analogy is also drawn with non-related human heat-shock induced Satellite III (Sat III) transcripts (Jolly (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17020918).. Natural variation in hsr-omega expression influence rates of protein synthesis in Drosophila lines (Johnson (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19280368).. Small open reading frames (ORFs) present in hsr-omega are poorly conserved in different Drosophila species. A short ORF of 23â27 amino acids present in the hsr-omega-c sequence of three examined Drosophila species is translatable, but the predicted protein has not been detected (Fini (1989) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2500443).
Hsr1	None known	Characteristics	~600 nt. Likely to be unspliced and does not have a polyA tail (Shamovsky (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16554823).
Hsr1	None known	Expression	Constitutively expressed (Shamovsky (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16554823). . Appears to undergo some sort of conformation change upon heat shock (Shamovsky (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16554823).
Hsr1	None known	Function	Required for the heat shock response (Shamovsky (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16554823).. HSR1 and eEF1A (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1) are required to activate heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) upon heat shock. HSR1 binds to eEF1A upon heat shock, which then forms a complex with HSF1 (Shamovsky (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16554823).. Knockdown/inhibition of HSR1 prevents HSF1 activation and makes cells heat shock sensitive (Shamovsky (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16554823).
Hsr1	None known	Conservation	604 nuc HSR1 seq couldn't be found in any mammalian genome examined, nor in expressed sequence libraries (Kim (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20040589).. 3' of HSR1 shows nucleotide and protein sequence homology to bacterial chloride channel proteins (Kim (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20040589).. Sequence is most similar to chloride channel from bacterial species of order Burkholderiales.. Unclear if this is horizontal gene transfer or due to bacterial infection of the studied cells (Kim (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20040589).
Hsr1	None known	Misc	Robust experimental results for functionality of HSR1, despite uncertainty regarding its origins.
Hsr1	None known	Name	Hsr1: Heat shock RNA 1
HSUR1 and HSUR2	None known		Encoded by Herpesvirus saimiri, acts as a target mimic to miR-27, directing its degradation and manipulating host T cell gene expression. Similar to mechanism in murine cytomegalovirus.
HULC	None known	Characteristics	~500nuc, spliced, polyadenylated, two exon transcript (Panzitt (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241883).. Exon 1 mainly consists of an LTR (MLT1A) (Panzitt (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241883).
HULC	None known	Expression	Binding of phospho-CREB to the HULC promoter activates HULC expression. Phosphorylation of CREB was stimulated by PKA signaling (Wang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20423907). . Highly up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to a lesser extent in liver focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Up-regulation was specific to HCC with high expression not detected in normal liver, other tissues and their associated neoplasms (Panzitt (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241883).. HULC expression was also up-regulated in colorectal carcinomas that metastasised to the liver but not in primary colorectal carcinomas or carcinomas that metastasised to lymph nodes (Matouk (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19445043).. HULC RNA could be detected in the blood of HCC patients (Panzitt (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241883).. Localised to the cytoplasm, may associate with ribosomes, but no sign of translated products could be found (Panzitt (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241883).. HULC expression was also identified in 3 old world monkeys (Panzitt (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241883).
HULC	None known	Function	Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Functions as a sponge/ target mimic for miR-372 through a conserved target site, reducing the expression and activity of miR-372 (Wang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20423907).. One of targets of miR-372 is Prkacb (catalytic subunit of PKA) which is able to phophorylate CREB. Hence expression of HULC stimulates further HULC expression by inhibiting miR-372, and allowing PRKACB to create active CREB (Wang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20423907).. HULC knockdown affects expression of other genes including some described in liver cancer (Panzitt (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241883).
HULC	None known	Conservation	HLUC also present in other primates, gene shows good conservation above that of surrounding sequence. Not detected in rodents so may be primate specific (Panzitt (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241883).
HULC	None known	Name	HULC: Highly upregulated in liver cancer RNA
ICR1	None known	Characteristics	~3.15kb capped and polyadenylated single exon transcript.. Expressed in FLO11 regulatory region.. ICR1 has variable start and termination sites. Begins between ~3.2 and 3.4kb upstream of FLO11, runs towards FLO11 in sense direction, some transcripts stop before FLO11 while others can overlap the 5' of the PTC gene.. A second 1.2kb lncRNA PWR1 - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Default.aspx?TKeyID=236 is expressed antisense to ICR1.
ICR1	None known	Expression	Expression of ICR1 and PWR1 is inversely correlated. . ICR1 expression requires the Sfl1 transcription factor, which is known to repress FLO11, and is repressed by the Flo8 transcription factor and the Rpd3L HDAC protein.. PWR1 expression requires Rpd3L and Flo8 and is repressed by Sfl1.
ICR1	None known	Function	ICR1 regulates expression of the FLO11/MUC1 gene in cis, in conjunction with a second lncRNA PWR1 - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Default.aspx?TKeyID=236.. Expression of ICR1 represses expression of FLO11, probably by promoter occlusion. . Expression of ICR1 is repressed by PWR1 (again probably by promoter occlusion in-cis), allowing expression of FLO11, so the regulatory circuit depends on whether PWR1 is expressed or repressed.. ICR1 is lowly expressed constitutively and competition between Flo8 and Sfl1 transcription factors determines which ncRNA is expressed and therefore if FLO11 is on or off.
ICR1	None known	Misc	FLO11/ MUC1 - cell surface glycoprotein that controls cell-cell adhesion and shows variegated expression in a clonal population of yeast cells (ie: expressed at high levels in some cells, silenced in others).. Sequence of ICR1 on chromosome IX from coordinates 397079 to 393881 available from http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?sgdid=S000132612
ICR1	None known	Name	ICR1: interfering Crick RNA 1
IGF2AS	PEG8	Characteristics	Spliced transcript from bidirectional promoter with Igf2. Overlaps some Igf2 isoforms in antisense direction (mouse and human).. ~4.8kb mouse transcript, four exons. Multiple splice isoforms in human, 2 or 3 exons, ~2 or ~2.8kb. Most homology is towards 3' of transcripts (Okutsu (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10731720).
IGF2AS	PEG8	Expression	Imprinted, expressed from paternal allele (Okutsu (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10731720). Igf2as generally retains imprinting in tumours even when Igf2 becomes bi-allelically expressed (Vu (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12702581). . Ubiquitously, but lowly, expressed in human adult and fetal tissues. 2 exon (has retained intron) isoform was specific to adult liver (Vu (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12702581). . Like Igf2, Igf2as showed highly up-regulated expression in Wilms tumour samples compared to neighbouring normal kidney tissue. 
IGF2AS	PEG8	Function	SNP polymorphisms in Igf2as associate with increased muscle damage (strength loss and soreness) after eccentric exercise, as do SNPs found in IGF2 (Devaney (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17289909).
IGF2AS	PEG8	Conservation	Human Igf2as contains a predicted ORF, however this is not present in mouse (Okutsu (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10731720).. Also expressed and imprinted in pig (Bischoff (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571260).
IGF2AS	PEG8	Name	IGF2AS: Insulin-like growth factor 2 antisense . PEG8: Paternally expressed gene 8
IPS1	TPSI/Mt4 family	Characteristics	IPS1 is a member of a family of RNAs induced by phosphate starvation in plants that have short non-conserved ORFs (Liu (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9106510, Burleigh (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9207836, Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366, MartÃ­n (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11123795, Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506) and a region of complementarity to miR-399  (Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101).. RNA of ~540 nuc (MartÃ­n (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11123795).
IPS1	TPSI/Mt4 family	Expression	Expression induced upon phosphate starvation and accumulates into the roots and shoots (MartÃ­n (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11123795).. Hormonal signaling by cytokinins repressed IPS1 expression in the roots (MartÃ­n (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11123795).
IPS1	TPSI/Mt4 family	Function	IPS1 has complementarity to miR-399, but contains a mismatch loop that renders it uncleavable when miR-399 binds. Since target cleavage is the usual plant miRNA pathway the non-cleavable nature of IPS1 acts to sequester the miRNA (Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101).. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). IPS1 carries out target mimicry to sequester miR-399 and attenuate its effects allowing increased expression of miR-399 targets including PHO2 (Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101).
IPS1	TPSI/Mt4 family	Conservation	IPS1 family members have been identified in a number of plant species (Liu (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9106510, Burleigh (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9207836, Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366, MartÃ­n (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11123795, Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506, Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101). . However apart from At4 and IPS1 homology between family members is generally limited to the miR-399 binding site (Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366, Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506).
IPS1	TPSI/Mt4 family	Misc	Other family members include At4 - http://www.lncrnadb.com/detail.aspx?TKeyid=215, At4-1 - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/42741749, At4-2 - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/41396887 and At4-3 - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucest/5842364?report=genbank in Arabidopsis thaliana (Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366, Shin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460506 Franco-Zorrilla (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643101), TPS11 - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1009717?report=genbank  in tomato (Liu (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9106510), Mt4 - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/2231317 in Barrel Clover and Alfalfa (Burleigh (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9207836), Mt4-like in Soybean (Burleigh (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880366). 
IPS1	TPSI/Mt4 family	Name	IPS1: Induced by phosphate starvation 1
IPW	NCRNA00002		Annotation in Progress
IPW	NCRNA00002	Expression	Ubiquitously expressed in humans. From part of Snurf-Snrpn domain that shows ubiquitous human expression (Vitali (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20016068). Host transcript for multiple snoRNA genes.. Mouse RNA stability was close to median for lncRNAs, with a half-life of 3.2 hr in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755). 
IPW	NCRNA00002	Name	Imprinted in Prader-Willi syndrome
Jpx	Enox, NCRNA00183	Names	Jpx; Enox (expressed neighbor of Xist)
Jpx	Enox, NCRNA00183	Characteristics	Spliced (5 exons), with multiple isoforms. Located at the X-inactivation center (XIC), transcribed from an unmethylated CpG island 10 kb upstream of Xist. Transcribed in antisense orientation to Xist. (Johnston (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12160738)
Jpx	Enox, NCRNA00183	Expression	Ubiquitously expressed.. Up-regulated during both male and female embryonic stem cell differentiation (Tian (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21029862).
Jpx	Enox, NCRNA00183	Function	Involved in the regulation of X chromosome inactivation in mammals via activation of the Xist RNA, possibly by interfering with Tsix expression (Tian (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21029862)..

Kcnq1ot1	LIT1, KvLQT1-AS, KvLQT1OT1	Characteristics	91 kb, unspliced; imprinted (paternally expressed), it is transcribed from intron 10 of the maternally expressed Kncq1 (KvLQT1) gene from a CpG island that is the imprinting control region (IC2) (Smilinich (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10393948). This imprinted region contains at least eight genes that are expressed exclusively or preferentially from the maternal allele (Kanduri (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345374).
Kcnq1ot1	LIT1, KvLQT1-AS, KvLQT1OT1	Expression	Nuclear localised. . Expressed in most human tissues.. Mouse RNA found to be highly unstable with a half-life <2 hr in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755)
Kcnq1ot1	LIT1, KvLQT1-AS, KvLQT1OT1	Function	Summary: Kcnq1ot1 has a role in the organization of a tissue/lineage-specific nuclear domain involved in epigenetic silencing of the Kcnq1 imprinting control region.. Genes imprinted by kcnq1ot1 include Kcnq1, Cdkn1c, Slc22a18 and Phlda2, which are ubiquitously imprinted and Cd81, Osbpl5, Tssc4, Tspan32 and Ascl2, which are only imprinted in placenta (reviewed in Kanduri (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345374. An expansion of the Kncq1ot1 imprinted domain to include splice variants of Th and Ins2 was recently described (Jones (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21576366). . Kcnq1ot1 silences genes by coating chromatin and recruiting repressive chromatin remodeling complexes such as G9a, PRC1 and PRC2 (Terranova (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18848501, Pandey (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18951091, Umlauf (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15516932, Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659) .. Kcnq1ot1 transcript has a modular structure, the silencing element (that mediates the epigenetic silencing and directs the imprinted locus to a heterochromatin environment in the perinucleolar region) appears to be a short <1kb conserved sequence near the 5' of the transcript (Mohammad (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299392).. Kcnq1ot1 forms a silenced subdomain (Terranova (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18848501)(Redrup (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144718) commonly localised to the perinucleolar region during S phase (Mohammad (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299392). The silenced subdomain may be important to the maintenance of transcriptional repression.. Kcnq1ot1 interacts with Dnmt1 and recruits it to somatically acquired differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes (Mohammad (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573698).. In vivo knockout study shows that paternal inheritance of a deletion encompassing an 890-bp (Delta890) silencing domain downstream of the Kcnq1ot1 promoter leads reduced interaction with DNMT1 and to selective incomplete relaxation of the imprinting of imprinted genes in a tissue-specific manner (Mohammad (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573698).. Delta890 showed altered DNA methylation at somatically acquired DMRs but not in histone modifications of the ubiquitously imprinted genes. Thus, it has been proposed that the ubiquitous and placental-specific imprinting of genes within the Kcnq1 domain might be mediated by distinct mechanisms, and Kcnq1ot1 RNA might mediate the silencing of ubiquitously imprinted genes by maintaining allele-specific methylation through its interactions with Dnmt1 (Mohammad (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573698).
Kcnq1ot1	LIT1, KvLQT1-AS, KvLQT1OT1	Conservation	Patches of highly conserved repeats in 5' side of transcript, which contains the silencing domain (Mohammad (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299392). Promoter control elements are highly conserved between mouse and humans, including CCAAT elements that are targets of NF-Y regulation (Pandey (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15459184), as well as the position of CpG islands in the imprinting control region (Paulsen (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15590939).

Khps1a	Khps1	Characteristics	1290 nt*; originates from the CpG island and overlaps a "tissue-dependent differentially methylated region" (T-DMR) of Sphk1. Single-exon, 5'-capped and 3'-polyadenylated, it spans the region -2095 to -3384 in relation to the commonly used +1 translation start site for Sphk1 subtypes, which covers the entire region of the T-DMR (-3233 to -3023) and the alternative first exons of both Sphk1a and -c (Imamura (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325271).. *Northern blot with probes for Khps1 also indicates the presence of transcripts with different sizes (600-20,000nt).
Khps1a	Khps1	Expression	Expression of Khps1 is detected in many tissues, with high levels in the kidney and only weakly expressed in the liver and brain. Expression was detected in the cytoplasm of primary cell culture from rat  fetuses, as well as nuclei in some cells, indicating that Khps1 is exported to the cytoplasm (Imamura (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325271).. Similar to Sphk1, the expression of Khps1 is also detected from only one allele (demonstrating that it is also imprinted), and Khps1 and Sphk1 show mutually exclusive expression in individual cells (Imamura (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325271).. Identified as a PROMPT (promoter upstream transcript) which are degraded by the exosome and generally highly unstable (Preker (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19056938).
Khps1a	Khps1	Function	Regulates DNA methylation in the T-DMR of Sphk1 promoter (Imamura (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325271; Preker (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19056938). In vitro over-expression of two fragments of Khps1 in NRK cells cause demethylation of CG sites of the T-DMR, but which is accompanied of DNA methylation at three CC(A/T)GG sites (Imamura (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325271).
Khps1a	Khps1	Conservation	Rat Khps1a exhibits 88.7% and 56.2% nucleotide sequence identity with corresponding DNA sequences in the genome databases at NCBI for human and mouse  (Accession Nos. NT_1010641 and NT_039521), respectively (Imamura (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325271).. ESTs overlapping Sphk1 T-DMR CpG island in mouse, homologous to the CpG island of rat Sphk1, are described (mouse EST AA796730 shows 87% similarity with the CpG island of rat  Sphk1). Human transcripts in the region were also detected by RT-PCR in HEK293 and HeLa cells (Imamura (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325271).
Khps1a	Khps1	Misc	There are possible open reading frames in Khps1a, in which the maximal size is 306 bp, but no recognizable amino acid motifs or domains in the possible proteins were found, and three possible start codons in the rat  Khps1a aligned with different codons in the corresponding human genomic DNA sequences (Imamura (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325271).

KRASP1 is hypothesised to act as a decoy for miRNAs targeting KRAS, similar to how PTENP1 acts a decoy for PTEN (Poliseno (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20577206).. Expression of the KRASP1 3'UTR sequence lead to de-repression of KRAS mRNA levels and increased cellular proliferation (Poliseno (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20577206).

L1PA16	None known	Function	Fragment from L1PA16 found to bind hPSF protein and release it from GAGE6 proto-oncogene regulatory DNA in-vitro and in-vivo (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).. L1PA16 expression caused increased colony formation in culture and a small increase in tumour formation in mice (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).. Suggests L1PA16 has oncogenic activity by repressing hPSF tumour suppressor activity (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).
L1PA16	None known	Conservation	Only described in humans to date
linc-MD1		Characteristics	Three exon transcript. Contains miR-206 in second intron and miR-133b in third and final exon. Has binding sites for miR-135 in exon2 and miR-133 in exon 3. This structure is conserved in mouse and humans.. Shows evidence of alternative splicing of exon 2 in mouse. This alternative isoform no longer contains the miR-135 binding sites. Functional characterization was on the standard isoform containing the miRNA recognition sequences.. PolyA+
linc-MD1		Expression	Expression induced during myoblast differentiation but absent in proliferating myoblasts in mouse and humans.. In mouse tissues expression was restricted to certain skeletal muscles where it was found only in "newly regenerating fibres". Expression is found more widely found amongst skeletal muscle of mutant mice which do not express dystrophin. . Conversely in myoblasts from humans with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), there was little linc-MD1 expression and MYOG and MHC expression was also reduced.  . Predominately cytoplasmic.. Promoter regions near the linc-MD1 and miR-206 TSSs contain conserved CANNTG (E-box) sequences, and are bound by the muscle transcription factor MyoD. During myoblast differentiation and in muscles where linc-MD1 is expressed these promoter regions (plus others) form long distance chromatin interactions.
linc-MD1		Function	Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Binds miR-135 and miR-133 and inhibits their repressive action, including on MEF2C and MAML1, two transcription factors required for proper muscle differentiation.. linc-MD1 required for normal up-regulation of MYOG, MHC and MCK genes during myoblast differentiation. . Nb: These linc-MD1 effects were also observed when linc-MD1 was mutated so miR-133b could not be released from the sequence, showing this effect was due to the lincRNA transcript. 
linc-MD1		Conservation	Exon 1 and the region of exon 3 containing miR-133b is conserved in mammals and also back to chicken. Exon 2 conserved in mammals.
linc-MD1		Misc	Expression of miR-206 and miR-133b is specific to muscle tissue. miR-133b expression profile closely corresponds to that of linc-MD1.. Sequence provided is only partial length, it was reported that the transcript 3' ends are 1060 and 1450 nt further downstream.

lincRNA-Cox2	AK144630	Characteristics	Spliced ~1.7kb transcript. . Sequence contains multiple repeat elements.
lincRNA-Cox2	AK144630	Misc	Found ~50kb from Cox2 (Ptgs2), which is also induced by NFkB.
lincRNA-p21	Ak144811, Gm16197	Characteristics	~3.1kb, spliced, 2 exon transcript. . Starts ~15kb upstream and on the opposite strand to p21 (Cdkn1a) gene in mouse.
lincRNA-p21	Ak144811, Gm16197	Expression	Transcriptional target of p53. P53 binds to the lincRNA-p21 promoter and up-regulates expression upon DNA damage and in various tumour cell lines.. Enriched in nucleus.. Complete length and structure of human lincRNA-p21 not defined, but it too appears to be regulated by p53.. Mouse RNA was stable with a half-life of 6.2 hr in in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells, well above the median lncRNA half-life (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
lincRNA-p21	Ak144811, Gm16197	Function	LincRNA-p21 acts to repress many genes transcriptionally regulated by p53.. LincRNA-p21 gene repression is mediated (at least in part) by lincRNA binding to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) through its 5' end. hnRNP-K associates with the promoters of many genes repressed by lincRNA-p21 in a lincRNA-p21 dependent manner.. LincRNA-p21 is necessary for p53-dependent apoptotic induction, but not cell cycle arrest.
lincRNA-p21	Ak144811, Gm16197	Conservation	At least some sequences within lincRNA-p21 are well conserved in mammals.
lincRNA-p21	Ak144811, Gm16197	Misc	Nb: Cdkn1a (p21) cell cycle regulator is also a p53 target gene.

Also more highly expressed in iPSCs than ESCs.. Locus is a binding site for pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Knockdown of Oct4 or differentiation of stem cells caused down-regulation of lincRNA-RoR expression. Suggesting expression is controlled by these transcription factors.
lincRNA-RoR	lincRNA-Regulator of Reprogramming
<br>lincRNA-ST8SIA3	Function	Functions to promote reprogramming of differentiated cells to iPSCs.. - Knockdown decreased the number of iPSC colonies formed without affecting cell number. While over-expression increased the number of iPSC colonies formed.. Functions in maintenance of ESCs and iPSCs.. - Knockdown lead to modest increase in apoptosis and activation of p53 pathways.
lincRNA-RoR	lincRNA-Regulator of Reprogramming
<br>lincRNA-ST8SIA3	Conservation	No syntenic correlate expressed in mouse ESCs. Some exons appear to be transcribed from human specific repeat sequences. While others appear limited to certain primates.
lincRNA-SFMBT2		Expression	LincRNA enriched in ESC (embryonic stem cells) and iPSCS (induced pluripotent stem cells) compared to the fibroblast and CD34 cells the iPSCs were derived from. . Also more highly expressed in iPSCs than ESCs.. Locus is a binding site for pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Knockdown of Oct4 or differentiation of stem cells caused down-regulation of lincRNA- SFMBT2 expression. Suggesting expression is controlled by these transcription factors.
lincRNA-SFMBT2		Function	Function not certain: knockdown didnât affect generation of iPSC cells, suggesting it is not essential to this process.
lincRNA-SFMBT2		Conservation	No syntenic correlate expressed in mouse ESCs.
lincRNA-SFMBT2		Misc	The chromosomal region given in Loewer et al (2010) is for histone modifications and does not identify the precise transcript expressed in stem cells. Furthermore their qPCR primers do not correspond to exonic regions from the known transcript AK094154 at this locus, so no transcript sequence can be given.. lincRNA-SFMBT2 location from histone modifications is: hg19 chr10:6,779,694-6,889,494
lincRNA-Sox2	None known	Characteristics	LincRNA ~100kb from the Sox2 transcription factor in mouse (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780).
lincRNA-Sox2	None known	Expression	Expressed in embryonic stem cells but not in other cells tested (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780).. Promoter bound by Oct4 and Nanog (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780).. Promoter cloning showed expression can be driven by Sox2 and Oct4 individually and synergistically (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780).
lincRNA-Sox2	None known	Misc	The chromosomal position of the lincRNA given in Guttman et al., (2009) is quite broad, however it is probable that it corresponds to the sequence, Accession ID and Browser link provided. 
lincRNA-VLDLR		Expression	LincRNA enriched in ESC (embryonic stem cells) and iPSCS (induced pluripotent stem cells) compared to the fibroblast and CD34 cells the iPSCs were derived from.. Also more highly expressed in iPSCs than ESCs.. Locus is a binding site for pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Knockdown of Oct4 or differentiation of stem cells caused a modest down-regulation of lincRNA-VLDLR expression. Suggesting expression is controlled by these transcription factors.
lincRNA-VLDLR		Conservation	Reported to have a syntenic correlate expressed in mouse ESCs.
lincRNA-VLDLR		Misc	The chromosomal region given in Loewer et al (2010) is for histone modifications and does not identify the precise transcript expressed in stem cells. Furthermore their qPCR primers do not correspond to exonic regions from the known EST CD247089 within this locus, so no transcript sequence can be given.. lincRNA-VLDLR location from histone modifications is: hg19 chr9:2,207,775-2,298,675
LINoCR	None known	Characteristics	Antisense RNA from the lysozyme regulatory region.. Promoter is -1.9kb hormone response element. Transcript extends several hundred nucleotides from a -2.120bp start site through the -2.4kb CTCF binding site to the -2.7kb enhancer.
LINoCR	None known	Expression	Transient pulse of LINoCR expression after LPS treatment of macrophages. This expression correlates with upregulation of the lysozyme gene and eviction of the CTCF repressor and positioning of a nucleosome over the CTCF binding site. . Fast decrease in RNA levels suggested a half-life of 45min or less.
LINoCR	None known	Function	LINoCR expression was necessary for chromatin remodeling to switch the lysozyme regulatory region into an active confirmation. . CTCF protein acts to repress transcription of the lysozyme gene.. Repression of LINoCR expression prevented eviction of CTCF from the -2.4kb element as well as histone modifications of this site and positioning of a nucelosome over the CTCF binding site. This demonstrated that LINoCR expression was necessary for CTCF eviction.. Whether the LINoCR transcript has a function or if it is simply the act of transcription which is necessary is unknown. 
LINoCR	None known	Name	LINoCR: LPS Inducible NonCoding RNA
LINoCR	None known	Conservation	Identified in chicken.
LOC100887755	Noncoding RNA activating7: ncRNA-a7, ENST00000431460.1
	Characteristics	Two exon, 600 nt transcript. Around 50 kb 3â from SNAI1 on the opposite strand.. In-vitro translation showed no sign of protein product.
LOC100887755	Noncoding RNA activating7: ncRNA-a7, ENST00000431460.1
	Expression	Expressed in A549 cells.
LOC100887755	Noncoding RNA activating7: ncRNA-a7, ENST00000431460.1
	Function	LncRNA regulates gene expression through SNAI1 dependant and independent mechanisms. . Stimulates SNAI1 gene expression (in A549 cells) and like SNAI1 is required for cell migration.. Stimulates Aurora-kinase A (AURKA) expression, a gene found ~6 megabases from LOC100887755 on chr20. SNAI1 does not appear to regulate AURKA and so LOC100887755 appears to regulate AURKA by a SNAI1 independent mechanism.
LOC285194	LSAMP-AS3	Features	Together with the noncoding RNA BC040587 and the tumor suppressor gene LSAMP (limbic system-associated membrane protein), LOC285194 is present in the focal region of chr3q13.31 (osteo3q13.31), which is the most altered region in osteosarcomas. These genes are proposed to be cooperatively acting tumor suppressors.. Recurrent focal copy-number changes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which usually involves loss of LOC285194 and BC040587 expression, implicate these ncRNAs in ostecosarcoma. Focal osteo3q13.31 CNAs and LOH are also common in cell lines from several other cancers (such as lung, autonomic and central nervous system, blood, endometrium, soft tissue, skin, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and breast).. Depletion of LOC285194 by siRNA promoted proliferation of normal osteoblasts (with a mild increase in the G1 population) by cell-cycle transcripts (Cyclin D1, VEGF, and VEGFR1 up-regulation, and cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 suppression) as well as regulation of apoptotic genes (such as suppression of BCL2 and BimEL pro-apoptotic genes).. Genetic deletions of LOC285194 or BC040587 in  tumor DNA were also associated with dramatic decrease in survival of osteosarcoma patients.
LUST	Je2	Characteristics	~1.4 - 2.4 kb. Intronic, unspliced and transcribed antisense to the putative tumour suppressor gene RBM5/LUCA-15/H37, spanning introns 6 to 4 (Rintala-Maki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559772).. Contains SINE elements.
LUST	Je2	Expression	Originally cloned from an human bone marrow library (Sutherland (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10949932), this transcript is abundant in skeletal and cardiac muscle (as detected by Northern blot) (Rintala-Maki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559772).
LUST	Je2	Function	*Transfection of Jurkat T cells with a 326 bp fragment of LUST (originally termed Je2) suppresses CD95-mediated apoptosis (Sutherland (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10949932).. *Ectopic over-expression of LUST affects splicing of RBM5: it correlates with elevated expression of the full-length RBM5+5+6 splice variant, and with reduced expression of the truncated RBM5+5+6t isoform, which is cytotoxic (Rintala-Maki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559772). 
LUST	Je2	Name	LUST: LUCA-15-specific transcript.
LXRBSV	None known	Characteristics	In mouse, LXRBSV is an alternative splicing isoform of LXR-beta that has a 270bp intronic sequence retained between exons 4 and 5 (or exons 2 and 3 depending on LXR-beta isoform). Quantitative expression and promoter reporter assays indicated that LXRBSV is preferentially transcribed and expressed in the pituitary (Hashimoto (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211147).. 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) produced a 677 bp PCR product and indicated that the transcriptional start site (TSS) of LXRBSV is located 40 bp downstream of LXR-beta's TSS (Hashimoto (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211147).. A LXRBSV construct was translated as an approximately 22 kDa protein by in-vitro translation.
LXRBSV	None known	Expression	LXRBSV was detected in various tissues, such as liver and different regions of the brain (pituitary, hypothalamus, cerebrum, cerebellum). It was expressed at lower levels than LXR-beta (Hashimoto (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19878653).. Quantitative expression and promoter reporter assays indicated that LXRBSV is preferentially transcribed and expressed in the pituitary. LXRBSV expression in the whole brain and especially in the pituitary was significantly higher compared to that in the liver. This is in contrast to LXR-beta mRNA that showed similar expression in the liver and brain and significantly reduced expression in the pituitary and hypothalamus compared to liver (Hashimoto (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211147).
LXRBSV	None known	Function	LXRBSV acts as a specific transcriptional co-activator for LXR-beta to enhance its receptor-mediated transactivation. LXRBSV synergistically augmented ligand-dependent activation of the SREBP-1c promoter (Sterol Response Element Binding Protein-1c promoter), but not of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and peroxidase proliferator and activating receptors (PPARs).. The intronic sequence inserted into LXRBSV is required for its transactivation activity.. LXRBSV protein was deduced to be 64 amino acids in length, but different evidence demonstrated that the alternative splicing transcript acts as a RNA co-activator: 1) a GAL4-LXRBSV fusion protein was not able to induce transactivation; 2) an ATG mutant of LXRBSV was able to induce transactivation as wild type, and 3) LXRBSV functions in the presence of cycloheximide (Hashimoto (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19878653).
LXRBSV	None known	Name	LXRBSV: Liver X receptor (LXR)-beta alternative splicing variant (Hashimoto (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19878653).
LXRBSV	None known	Misc	Because the LXRB locus produces both functional protein-coding and regulatory RNA transcripts, it may be considered a 'bi-functional' locus.
Malat1	Neat2	Characteristics	Intergenic ~7kb single exon transcript (Ji (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970751, Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048).. A conserved tRNA-like sequence at the 3' end is cleaved off and processed to generated a short tRNA-like ncRNA mascRNA (MALAT1-associated small cytoplasmic RNA) (Wilusz (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041754).. Post transcriptional processing of Malat1 therefore allows two ncRNAs to be created from the one original transcript (Wilusz (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041754).
Malat1	Neat2	Expression	Both Malat1 and the processed mascRNA transcript are expressed in a wide range of tissues (Ji (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970751, Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048, Wilusz (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041754), Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808), (Ulitsky (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22196729). . Malat1 is highly expressed in the brain. RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) on adult mouse brain sections showed high expression of nuclear-localized Malat1 transcripts in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and neurons of the substantia nigra and motoneurons, but very low levels in non-neuronal cells (Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808). In the hippocampus and in Purkinje cells, Malat1 was first detected between post-natal day 0 (P0) and P7 and its level increased until P28 (Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808). This high expression appears to come from up-regulation of Malat1 during differentiation, with in-vitro differentiation of neural stem cells showing significant up-regulation of expression in neuronal and glial differentiated progeny (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068).. Expressed in the nucleus accumbens of normal human brains and upregulated in this brain region in heroin abusers (Michelhaugh (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21128942). . In neuroblastoma cells Malat1 was up-regulated by the hormone oxytocin (Koshimizu (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20149803). . Malat1 is up-regulated in a range of cancers (Ji (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970751, Yamada (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16441420, Lin (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16878148, Guffanti (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19379481).. High expression of Malat1 is associated with metastasis in certain histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is predictive of poor prognosis (Ji (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970751).. Malat1 is up-regulated in placenta previa increta/percreta, a disease characterised by excessive invasion of fetal placental trophoblasts into the uterus  (Tseng (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690017).. Malat1 is stable in human B cells and Hela and wt MEFs (half-life >7 hrs) but has significantly lower stability in mouse 3T3 and N2A cells. Suggesting differences in Malat1 stability both within and between species (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755, Tani (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369889).. Malat1 localises to SC35 domain nuclear speckles in several cell lines (Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048) (Clemson (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19217333). Localisation to nuclear speckles is transcription-dependent, as RNA pol II inhibition promoted re-distribution of Malat1 ncRNA from nuclear speckles to a homogenous nuclear localisation (Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808). Malat1 co-localises with pre-mRNA-splicing factor SF2/ASF and CC3 antigen in the nuclear speckles (Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808).. MALAT1 is enriched in nuclear speckles in interphase cells and concentrates in mitotic interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs, structural analogs of nuclear speckles present in mitotic cells), but unlike Neat1 it is not required for the structural integrity of the nuclear domain (Tripathi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886).. mascRNA derived from Malat1 is transported to the cytoplasm (Wilusz (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041754).
Malat1	Neat2	Conservation	Therian mammals (found in oppossum as well as placental mammals) (Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048).. Recently described in zebrafish. Sequence homology to zebrafish was limited to the 3â end, but the ~7kb long, single exon structure as well as positional synteny was conserved, as was the high expression in brain found identified in mammals (Ulitsky (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22196729).
Malat1	Neat2	Name	Malat1: Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1. Neat2: Nuclear enriched abundant transcript 2
Malat1	Neat2	Function	Summary: Malat1 has been found to regulate alternative splicing of endogenous target genes, and it is implicated in cancer and a series of molecular and cellular phenotypes, as indicated below.. Identified as an oncogene that promotes tumorigensis. Expression of a Malat1 fragment in NIH 3T3 cells transformed cells (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619). . Knockdown inhibited cell mobility and lead to decreased expression of several genes (CTHRC1, CCT4, HMMR, or ROD1) that promoted cell migration (Tano (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20937273). This result may also explain why knockdown inhibited trophoblast-like cell invasion in-vitro, with MALAT1 hypothesised to regulate the level of trophoblast invasion into the uterus in vivo (Tseng (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690017).. MALAT1 depletion resulted in aberrant mitosis, with a large fraction of cells accumulating at G2/M boundary, and increased cell death (Tripathi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886).. Depletion of Malat1 in neuroblastoma cells indicated that Malat1 affects the expression of genes involved not only in the organization and the function of the nucleus, but also in synapse function and dendrite development. In cultured hippocampal neurons, knock-down of Malat1 decreased synaptic density, whereas its over-expression resulted in a cell-autonomous increase in synaptogenesis (Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808).. There is a significant enrichment for SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) binding sites within the 5' half of both human and mouse MALAT1, whose direct interaction has been demonstrated, and is dependent on its canonical RRM (RRM1) or the pseudo RRM (RRM2) domains (Sanford (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19116412, Tripathi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886). Independent sequence elements in MALAT1 influence its distribution to nuclear speckles and the recruitment of SRSF1 (Tripathi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886).. Additional interactions have been found between MALAT1 and SRSF1, SRSF2, and SRSF3 proteins, but only weak interactions with SRSF5 and PSP1 (an RNA-binding protein that is a component of paraspeckles) have been identified (Tripathi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886).. Knock-down of nuclear Malat1 in a transfected U2OS cell line showed that it modulates the recruitment of SR proteins (SRSF1 or SF2/ASF and SC35) to a transcriptionally active transgene array (stably integrated), indicating a role in the regulation of the association of pre-mRNA-splicing factors to transcription sites and control of post-transcriptional gene expression (Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808). Malat1 modulates the speckle association of a subset of pre-mRNA splicing factors, such as SF1, U2AF-65, SF3a60, and B-U2snRNP (Tripathi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886).. Malat1-depleted HeLa cells show increased cellular levels of dephosphorylated SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) (Bernard (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808), as well as a moderately increased cytoplasmic pool of poly(A)+ RNA (Tripathi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886). It has recently been shown to regulate alternative splicing of endogenous target genes by modulating SR splicing factor phosphorylation, affecting their levels and the distribution and ratio of phosphorylated to dephosphorylated pools (Tripathi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886). 
Malat1-as	Malat1 antisense, Neat2 antisense	Characteristics	Northern identifies a transcript of around 6kb.
Malat1-as	Malat1 antisense, Neat2 antisense	Expression	Identified in mouse embyonic stem cells (mESCs).
Malat1-as	Malat1 antisense, Neat2 antisense	Function	Binds PRC2 chromatin modifying complex, while the sense Malat1/Neat2 transcript does not.
Malat1-as	Malat1 antisense, Neat2 antisense	Misc	As the transcript itself is not defined no accurate ucsc browser link is possible, although it's putative length combined with the PCR primers and northern probe utilized by Zhao 2010 suggest a significant overlap with Malat1.
mascRNA	Malat1	Characteristics	mascRNA is a conserved, 61 nucleotide, tRNA-like sequence at the 3' end of Malat1 that is cleaved off the full length transcript and processed to generate a short tRNA-like ncRNA.. Mature mascRNA undergoes a post-transcriptional CCA addition and folds into a tRNA like structure but could not be amino acylated.
mascRNA	Malat1	Name	mascRNA (MALAT1-associated small cytoplasmic RNA)
mascRNA	Malat1	Conservation	Conserved in mammals and back to reptiles and amphibians. More highly conserved than most of Malat1.
mascRNA	Malat1	Expression	mascRNA was cleaved off Malat1 in a wide variety of human tissues. . mascRNA is cleaved off Malat1 by RNaseP in the nucleus before further processing by RNaseZ and then exported to the cytoplasm.
Maternal RNA templates	Oxytricha trifallax genome unscrambling guide RNAs	Characteristics & Expression	Template/ Guide RNAs believed to arise from the maternal somatic nucleus (Nowacki (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046331).. Long sense and antisense RNA transcripts, which appear to be transcribed full length nanochromsomes (contained telomere sequences), from the somatic nucleus were identified during early development when rearrangement is believed to be occurring (Nowacki (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046331).
Maternal RNA templates	Oxytricha trifallax genome unscrambling guide RNAs	Function	Maternal RNAs programming DNA rearrangements in progeny (Nowacki (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046331).. Act as RNA guides or scaffolds to direct rearrangements. RNAi against them prevented unscrambling and injection of guides with altered gene sequences lead to the rearranged DNA containing the alteration (Nowacki (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046331).. Cellular machinery required to carry out the DNA fragmentation and recombination is not fully understood but transposase proteins from Oxytricha trifallax transposons are required (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19372392).. Also found that mutations in guide RNA can be transferred to the rearranged somatic genome. Suggesting the presence of RNA directed DNA repair and also of DNA variants inherited via RNA without changing the germline genome (Nowacki (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046331).
Maternal RNA templates	Oxytricha trifallax genome unscrambling guide RNAs	Inheritance	Non-mendelian epigenetic inheritance, independent from the germline (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).. Inheritance of the somatic genome via a transient RNA genome separate to the nuclear germline DNA genome (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).
Maternal RNA templates	Oxytricha trifallax genome unscrambling guide RNAs	Biological background	Ciliated protozoa contain two nuclei, a germline nucleus and a somatic nucleus.. - The somatic nucleus is transcriptionally active but not passed on after fertilization.. - The germline nucleus is transcriptionally inert in the mother cell but is transmitted to        progeny. The new somatic nucleus is created from this germline nucleus (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).. In Oxytricha trifallax creating the new somatic nucleus involves chromosomal fragmentation and deletion to remove ~95% of the genome (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).. Hundreds of thousands of short sequences must then be "unscrambled" by reordering or inversion to create a compact somatic genome of nanochromosomes  (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).. This extremely specific and reproducible  rearrangement has now been found to guided by maternal RNAs (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).

Maternal somatic nucleus RNAs	Paramecium tetraurelia maternal macronucleus noncoding RNAs	Biological background	Ciliated protozoa contain two nuclei, a germline nucleus and a somatic nucleus.. - The somatic nucleus is active but not passed on after fertilization.. - The germline nucleus is transcriptionally inert in the mother cell but is transmitted to progeny. The new somatic nucleus is created from this germline nucleus (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).. In Paramecium tetraurelia creating the new somatic nucleus requires widespread deletion of repetitive sequences and tens of thousands of internal eliminated sequences (IES) to create the compact somatic nucleus in the progeny (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).. Elimination of DNA appears to depend on whether it was present in the maternal somatic nucleus, with DNA present in the maternal somatic nucleus being retained in the progeny somatic nucleus. This process appears to be controlled by interactions between homologous short and long noncoding RNAs (Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).
Maternal somatic nucleus RNAs	Paramecium tetraurelia maternal macronucleus noncoding RNAs	Characteristics & Expression	DNA in the somatic nucleus is transcribed into sense and antisense noncoding RNAs during both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction (LepÃ¨re (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519642).
Maternal somatic nucleus RNAs	Paramecium tetraurelia maternal macronucleus noncoding RNAs	Function	RNA transcripts derived from DNA sequences in the maternal somatic nucleus are necessary but not necessarily sufficient to cause retention of this sequence in the progeny somatic nucleus (LepÃ¨re (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519642).. For example: introduction of an IE sequence into the maternal somatic nucleus is able to maintain the presence of that IES in the somatic nucleus of the progeny in some cases (Duharcourt (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7649484, Duharcourt (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9819394).. However degradation of IES RNA transcripts during the vegetal growth stage prevented maintenance of that IES in progeny somatic nuclei, showing long noncoding transcripts from the maternal somatic nuclei were necessary for maintenance of the DNA in progeny (LepÃ¨re (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519642).. Paramecium expresses a complex population of ~25 nuc germline Scan RNAs (scnRNAs) during early meiosis which have homology to all types of germline sequences. Knockdown of scnRNAs allows retention of sequences normally deleted from the progeny somatic nucleus (LepÃ¨re (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19103667).. ScnRNA : Maternal ncRNA model . ScnRNAs signal sequences to be deleted while maternal RNAs signal sequences to be maintained. Hypothesised that maternal somatic RNAs deplete homologous germline scnRNAs, preventing excision of these sequences in progeny somatic nuclei. Whereas undepleted scnRNAs do cause excision of target DNA sequences (LepÃ¨re (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519642, LepÃ¨re (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19103667, Nowacki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799).

MEG3	Gtl2	Characteristics	~1.6 kb in humans with a number of splice isoforms and evidence of retained introns creating longer transcripts (Miyoshi (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10759892, Zhang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032057). . Similar situation in mouse and sheep with ~2kb - ~10kb transcripts due to alternative splicing, alternative 5' and 3' ends and retained introns.  (Schuster-Gossler (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9626496, Bidwell (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11683710, Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500)..  . Imprinted: Maternally expressed from the Dlk1-Gtl2 imprinted locus (Schuster-Gossler (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9626496, Miyoshi (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10759892). 
MEG3	Gtl2	Expression	Expressed in a temporal and spatially regulated manner: expressed early in mouse embryos in visceral yolk sac and embryonic ectoderm. Later in paraxial mesoderm, epithelial ducts, and also in skeletal muscle, cochlea, brain and eye (Schuster-Gossler (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9626496, Manji (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16342203). . Dynamically expressed during mouse CNS development. This includes expression during retinal development (Blackshaw (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823) and in many developing forebrain areas including the "diencephalon, ventral telencephalon, post mitotic cell layers of the neocortex and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus" (McLaughlin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16356785). Also found to be up-regulated during differentiation of neuronal progenitors to GABAergic neurons in vitro (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068).. Expressed in adult brain (Miyoshi (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10759892) but in a more restricted manner (McLaughlin (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16356785).  . Isoform Meg3a is detected in human normal pituitary gland, but is absent in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (Zhang (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14602737).. Expressed in the nucleus accumbens of normal human brains and upregulated in this brain region in heroin abusers (Michelhaugh (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21128942). Conversely, levels are decreased in the caudate nucleus of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative condition, Huntington's disease (Johnson (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22202438). . See cited papers for a more detailed analysis of developmental and tissue specific expression.
MEG3	Gtl2	Function	<b>Summary:</b> Meg3 is important for proper growth and development and is a putative tumour suppressor which functions to activate p53 and inhibit cell proliferation. Meg3 can also control gene expression at imprinted loci through recruitment of the PRC2 complex. . <b>Function in Cancer:</b>. Expression of the Meg3a splicing isoform was silenced in pituitary tumours and ectopic expression was found to inhibit growth in human cancer cells, leading to the proposition that Meg3 RNA acts as a growth suppressor (Zhang (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14602737).. Silencing of Meg3 is associated with meningioma pathogenesis and progression while ectopic expression inhibited growth and stimulated p53 (Zhang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20179190).. Meg3 knock-out increased expression of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) signaling pathway genes in the brain, suggesting the RNA has a role in the control of vascularization, and therefore may function as a tumor suppressor in part by inhibiting angiogenesis (Gordon (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20392836).. <b>Mechanism of action:</b>. Meg3 stimulates p53 expression and can also inhibit cell proliferation/ DNA synthesis in the absence of p53 suggesting these functions are independent of each other (Zhou (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17569660), Zhang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032057. Meg3 contains several predicted secondary structural elements common to all isoforms. Replacement of the motif most important in p53 activation with a different sequence that formed the same structure maintained Meg3 function showing the RNA structural motifs are critical to Meg3 function (Zhang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032057). . Meg3 binds the PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells.  Binding appears to be mediated by the 5â 1kb of the RNA (Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659).. Controls expression of Dlk1 at the Dlk1-Meg3 imprinted locus, likely by recruiting PRC2 to the Dlk1 locus in cis. Knockdown lead to increased expression of Dlk1 and Gtl2-as along with a decrease in Ezh2/PRC2 recruitment to and H3K27me3 marks at the Dlk1 promoter (Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659).. <b>Developmental phenotypes:</b>. Knockout of Meg3 and the Meg3 differentially methylated region (DMR) on the maternal allele lead to post-birth lethality, while paternal knockout lead to increased pre and post-birth lethality and growth retardation. However other lncRNAs (Rian, Meg9) were also down-regulated, perhaps due to the loss of the DMR, making attribution of the phenotype to specific lncRNAs difficult (Takahashi (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264764). A potentially more specific lacZ gene trap insertion gave a parent of origin dwarfism phenotype (Schuster-Gossler (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9626496).. Aberrant repression of Meg3 and other maternally expressed lncRNAs from the DLK1-Dio3 imprinting cluster is present in most induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and is responsible for the failure of iPSCs to form viable mice (Stadtfeld (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418860). . NB: iPSC embryos died mid-gestation, which was more severe than a maternal Meg3 KO (Takahashi (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264764) indicating the phenotypic impact of other lncRNAs from this locus (Stadtfeld (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418860).
MEG3	Gtl2	Conservation	Mammals.. Both the human and mouse gene have ten exons with the middle exons being those which are alternatively spliced in both species (Zhang (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032057).
MEG3	Gtl2	Misc	Contains a microRNA: miRNA 770 in the last intron, (although it appears that this intron is sometimes retained) (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).. A number of probes for Meg3 exist in NRED due to the large number of isoforms, accession IDs given are for probes that are common to most isoforms.
MEG3	Gtl2	Localisation	Localisation was generally nuclear, but some cells showed localisation to the cytoplasm or to both compartments (Schuster-Gossler (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9626496). In the nucleus Meg3 has been found associated with chromatin (Mondal (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20404130).
MEG3	Gtl2	Regulation	Expression of Meg3 is stimulated by cyclic-AMP (cAMP). cAMP stimulates CREB transcription factor(s) to bind a cyclic-AMP-response element (CRE) in the proximal promoter which is important for Meg3 expression. Methylation of this promoter region blocks cAMP action (Zhao (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16793321).
MEG9	Mirg	Characteristics	Imprinted: Maternally expressed lncRNA from the Dlk1-Dio3 locus, downstream from Rian (Seitz (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796779, Tierling (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16309881, Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500). Contains intronic miRNAs which are also maternally expressed (Seitz (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796779, Seitz (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15310658).. Mirg suggested to be a processed form of Meg9. Northern blot analysis identified a number of transcripts from this locus from ~1kb (putative Mirg transcript) to ~5.5kb (longer than cloned Meg9 transcript) (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).
MEG9	Mirg	Expression	Meg9/ Mirg show similar expression to other lncRNA from locus. Expressed in embryonic and extraembronic tissue but also found in adult skin and testis (Tierling (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16309881, Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500)..  . The large cluster of intronic miRNAs show a similar pattern of expression inlcuding in embryos and adult brain (Seitz (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15310658).  
MEG9	Mirg	Function	Transcript(s) from the Meg9 locus bind to the PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659).. Aberrant repression of Meg9 and other maternally expressed lncRNAs from the DLK1-Dio3 imprinting cluster is present in most induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and is responsible for the failure of iPSCs to form viable mice, with embryos dying mid-gestation (Stadtfeld (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418860).. Some Meg9 miRNAs have a known function, including one known to be important in brain development (Schratt (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16421561). Others are predicted to target Dlk1, a paternally expressed gene from the same imprinted locus (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).
MEG9	Mirg	Conservation	Meg 9 is present in mammals. However the Meg9 host mRNA for the miRNAs has not been identified in each species.. Meg9 microRNAs are mammalian specific (Seitz (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15310658).
MEG9	Mirg	Misc	Currently unclear if there is any overlap of transcripts from Rian/MEG8 and MEG9/Mirg loci. RNA sequencing by Guttman (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20436462 found no evidence for overlap in mESCs, but there is imprinted transcription in the region between them with the same expression patterns (Tierling (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16309881, Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).. Sequence given is EU616813.1 from mouse. Note that northern blotting has suggested longer (characterised) transcripts also exist.

<br></br>
Human: BX093813, LOC100507043
<br></br>
Mouse: 2810011L19Rik	Characteristics	Zebrafish linc-birc6: 2.4kb, 3 exons, alternative splicing. Antisense to intron of birc6. 5â of last exon alignable and contains a highly conserved region.. Human (antisense birc6) - full length transcript has not been characterised, at least 2 exons, 5â of second exon contains the highly conserved region.. Human LOC100507043 (upstream of BDKRB2) - ~3.2 kb, 2 exons, 5â of second exon contains the highly conserved region.. Mouse 2810011L19Rik  (upstream of BDKRB2) - 3.3 kb, 3 exons, 5â of final exon contains the highly conserved region.

<br></br>
Human: BX093813, LOC100507043
<br></br>
Mouse: 2810011L19Rik	Expression	Linc-birc6 was most highly expressed of zebrafish megamind homolgoues. Expressed in zebrafish nervous system. Brain and eye at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf), brain only at 72 hpf.. Expressed in brain in mammals.
megamind	Zebrafish: linc-birc6, linc-hhipl1
<br></br>
Human: BX093813, LOC100507043
<br></br>
Mouse: 2810011L19Rik	Function	Linc-birc6 was required for normal embronyic brain development in Zebrafish. Morpholinos to decrease transcript level or block conserved site had brain and eye development defects.. - Lack of functional megamind at 48 hpf caused âsmaller heads and eyes, enlarged brain ventricles (a hydrocephalic phenotype), and loss of NeuroD-positive cells in the retina and tectum.â. Defects could be recused by mature zebrafish megamind transcript (linc-birc6) as well as the mouse (AK012713, upstream of BDKRB2) and human (BX093813, antisense BIRC6) orthologues. . Conserved site was necessary, but not sufficient, to explain megamind function in zebrafish.

<br></br>
Human: BX093813, LOC100507043
<br></br>
Mouse: 2810011L19Rik	Conservation	Has core highly conserved region in vertebrates of 93 nt. 15 of conserved nucleotides are Tâs with 3 nt periodicity.

<br></br>
Mouse: 2810011L19Rik	Gene copies	Several genomic locations for megamind homologues are possible in vertebrate genomes and many vertebrates have more than one homologous copy.. Three possible positions for megamind homolgoues have been identified: . (1) Antisense to birc6 intron, â(2) gene desert upstream of bdkrb1/,2 and (3) near hhipl1 homologs (found only in fish genomes)". All contain a conserved region near the 5â of the final exon. . Zebrafish has expressed transcripts at all 3 loci, humans have (1) and (2).
meiRNA	sme2	Characteristics	~0.5kb. Unspliced, polyadenylated. Alternative polyadenylation may give rise to different isoforms of ~510 and ~440 nt (excluding polyA tail).
meiRNA	sme2	Expression	Mainly cytoplasmic but when bound to Mei2p becomes mainly nuclear localised in the Mei2p nuclear granule/ dot structure.. Expression of meiRNA is induced by nitrogen starvation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which causes a switch from the mitotic cell cycle to meiosis that is dependent on mei2.
meiRNA	sme2	Function	meiRNA specifically binds (both in-vivo and in-vitro) and is required for nuclear localisation of Mei2, which is an RNA-binding protein essential for premeiotic RNA synthesis and meiosis. Mei2p relocalises to nuclear granules/dot structures after binding to meiRNA, resulting in a cell switch from mitosis to meiosis.. Overexpression of meiRNA suppresses a temperature-sensitive defect of mei2+.. Mei2-meiRNA complex functions specifically at Meiosis I, and loss of function of meiRNA blocks meiosis, but not premeiotic DNA synthesis. 
meiRNA	sme2	Misc	Mei2 may interact with other regulatory RNAs. A Mei2 defective in RNA binding cannot promote meiosis, and causes premeiotic DNA synthesis inhibition. In addition, the cytoplasmic function of Mei2, which is independent of meiRNA, is also abrogated in the RNA-binding mutant.
MER11C	HERVK11	Characteristics	LTR retrotransposon. Human endogenous retrovirus.. Integenic.. Size of full length transcript unknown.
MER11C	HERVK11	Expression	Expressed in tumour cell lines but little expression in fibroblasts (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).
MER11C	HERVK11	Function	Fragment from Mer11C found to bind hPSF protein, can release it from GAGE6 proto-oncogene regulatory DNA in-vitro and in-vivo (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).. Expression caused increased colony formation in culture and a small increase in tumour formation in mice (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).. Suggests Mer11C has oncogenic activity by repressing hPSF tumour suppressor activity  (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).
MER11C	HERVK11	Conservation	Repeat is human specific
Mistral	Mira	Characteristics	Transcribed from region between Hoxa6 and Hoxa7.. 798 nt, single exon, polyA+.
Mistral	Mira	Expression	Expression in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) induced by retinoic acid treatment.. Activation of Mira expression occurs before expression of Hoxa6 and Hoxa7.
Mistral	Mira	Function	Role in activation of gene expression and cell differentiation. Required for the epigenetic activation of Hoxa6 and Hoxa7 and hence their target genes during mESC differentiation.. Mira was required for the recruitment of MLL1 to the Mira gene locus and the activation of Hoxa6 and Hoxa7. Mira mediated a local rearrangement in chromatin structure to bring the Mira, Hox66 and Hoxa7 loci into a complex providing a mechanism for MLL1 to act on HoxA6/A7 after recruitment to the Mira locus.. Mira bound to the SET domain of MLL1 through a short hairpin (activator binding motif, ABM) near the 3â end of the RNA. In vitro binding studies suggested MLL1 recruitment was mediated by Mira forming a RNA/DNA hybrid with a protruding ssRNA 3â end containing the ABM. 
Mrhl	Meiotic recombination hotspot locus non-coding RNA	Characteristics	Sense intronic to the Phkb gene, close by to a putative recombination hotspot in mouse.. 2.4kb unspliced transcript, has a TATA box and polyA signal so appears to be an independent polymerase II transcript transcribed from an intron.
Mrhl	Meiotic recombination hotspot locus non-coding RNA	Expression	Expressed in mouse testis, liver, kidney and spleen (by northern).
Mrhl	Meiotic recombination hotspot locus non-coding RNA	Conservation	Some small blocks of sequence is conserved throughout mammals.
Mrhl	Meiotic recombination hotspot locus non-coding RNA	Misc	Transcription start and termination sites were not precisely mapped, but since primer extension did give a small region for initiation and a polyA signal was found near the 3' end the coordinates and sequence provided are close to correct. 
MSUR1	None known	Characteristics	~1.7kb transcript consisting of the first 1700nuc of 18s rRNA followed by 31bp of non rRNA sequence. 3' sequence contains a polyA signal and the transcript is polyadenylated.. Length and identity of transcript was confirmed by RT-PCR and northern blotting with a 3' probe.
MSUR1	None known	Expression	Expressed in a broad range of tissues.. Up-regulated in the spinal cord of SOD1 mutant mice prior to onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) type symptoms.
MSUR1	None known	Function	In cell culture, mutations in SOD1 cause cell death, MSUR1 protect cells in a dose dependent manner and acts to decrease levels of hydroxl radicals and the oxidation of cellular proteins.. MSUR1 didn't affect the level of SOD1 protein, instead acting to reduce cellular oxidative stress. The mechanism of MSUR1 action is unknown.
MSUR1	None known	Misc	Mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) a fatal neurodegenerative condition. A mouse SOD1 mutant replicates this condition.. Genomic position of MSUR1 transcript not known.
MSUR1	None known	Name	MSUR1: mutant SOD1(G93A)-up-regulated RNA 1
Msx1as	None known	Characteristics	>2 kb, spliced, complementary (antisense) to the region extending from of the 3' end of exon 2 to the middle of intron 1 of the Msx1 gene (Berdal (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12489151, Blin-Wakkach (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390985).
Msx1as	None known	Expression	Msx1as transcript is expressed in mouse embryos at E9.5 before the initial steps of skeleton morphogenesis and cell differentiation, and continuously up to birth (Coudert (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157866). Expressed in differentiated dental and bone cells, being up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation and in developing tooth, bone and limb bud  (Coudert (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157866, Blin-Wakkach (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390985, ID=	12489151). Also detected in hair follicles and neural tube, tissues where Msx1 are expressed (Coudert (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157866).. Inversely correlated with Msx1 during mouse dental and bone differentiation with the two genes also showing a complementary spatial expression pattern (Coudert (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157866, Blin-Wakkach (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390985, Berdal (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12489151).. Msx1as transcript has also also detected by Northern blot analysis in dental epithelium and mesenchyme from a rat incisor (Blin-Wakkach (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390985).
Msx1as	None known	Function	Over-expression of Msx1as in-vitro results in the reduction of Msx1 protein in a dose-dependent manner (Berdal (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12489151). Msx1as is proposed to negatively regulate Msx1 during craniofacial and skeleton development. (Coudert (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157866, Blin-Wakkach (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390985, Berdal (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12489151)
Msx1as	None known	Conservation	Msx1as RNA has been detected in mice, rats, and humans. The transcription initiation site for Msx1as RNA was located by primer extension in both mouse and human in an identical region, including a consensus TATA box present in a highly conserved 66-bp region at the 3' UTR of Msx1 (Blin-Wakkach (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390985).
Msx1as	None known	Misc	The Msx1as putative TATA box is conserved in Msx2 cDNA sequences, suggesting a more general regulation pathway of the Msx gene family (Blin-Wakkach (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390985).
ncR-uPAR	NCRUPAR	Characteristics	~400 bp. RNA polymerase II transcript. Found several kb upstream of the human protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) gene.. Mostly made up of repeat sequences including an Alu element.
ncR-uPAR	NCRUPAR	Expression	Expressed during embryonic development.. Presence of the ncR-uPAR promoter sequence drives expression of a transgene during embryonic vascular development at E9, which recapitulates PAR-1 expression at E9 quite well. At E16 expression was seen in brain and in arteries but not veins.
ncR-uPAR	NCRUPAR	Function	ncR-uPAR can act in-trans to stimulate PAR-1 expression.. ncR-uPAR binds nuclear proteins in-vivo, which could provide a mechanism for it to positively regulate the PAR-1 promoter during embryogenesis.
ncR-uPAR	NCRUPAR	Misc	Refseq ncR-uPAR appears to be the ncR-uPAR promoter and the lncRNA sequence.

ncR-uPAR	NCRUPAR	Name	ncR-uPAR: non-protein coding RNA, upstream of F2R/PAR1
NDM29	29A	Characteristics	~130 nt. 'Alu-like RNA', it has a canonical Alu/7SL-derived sequence structure. Transcribed by RNA Polymerase III from the first intron of the ASCL3 (Achaete Scute-Like homologue 3) gene (Castelnuovo (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581224).
NDM29	29A	Expression	NDM29 expression was analyzed in 6 different cell types and found in abundant levels in neural cells (neuroblastoma cell lines SHSY5Y and SKNBE2, and primary culture of human glioma cells), but  at a very low levels in epithelial-derived cells (HeLa, HEK293, and primary cultures of skin fibrobroblast). NDM29 expression was increased in differentiating cells (Castelnuovo (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581224).. NDM29 RNA was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of SKNBE2 and HeLa cells, but enriched (~70%) in the latter (Castelnuovo (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581224).
NDM29	29A	Function	In humans, NDM29 maps in a genomic region whose deletion has been shown to be involved in neuroblastoma development (De Preter (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000168).. In-vitro over-expression of NDM29 promoted differentiation of neuroblastoma (NB) cells into cells with neuron-like features (including marker expression, morphology,  anchorage-dependent growth and excitatory properties), and a reduction in the tumor initiating ('stem-like') cell fraction in the NB cell population. In-vitro and in-vivo experiments indicated that increased expression of NDM29 restricts NB development and malignancy. It also lead to reduced expression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) mRNA in malignant NB cells, and so increased their susceptibility to doxorubicin and cis-platinum antiblastic drugs used in NB therapy (Castelnuovo (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581224).
NDM29	29A	Conservation	RNA was detected in humans - Alu-derived elements are restricted to primate lineage  (Castelnuovo (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581224).
NDM29	29A	Misc	NDM29 transcript comprises Alu sequences and unique sequences and might have been inserted into the genomic locus by retrotransposition (Castelnuovo (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581224).. Similar to 21A RNA, it is also a short interspersed nucleotide element, marked as AluJb elements. (Pagano (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17274687)
NDM29	29A	Name	NDM29: neuroblastoma differentiation marker 29 (Castelnuovo (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581224, Pagano (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17274687).
NEAT1	MEN epsilon/beta, VINC, TncRNA, linc1317	Characteristics	Two isoforms: ~3.7 (NEAT1 v1/ MEN epsilon) and ~23 kb (NEAT1 v2/ MEN beta) transcribed from the MEN1 locus (Guru (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9253601, Saha (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16760401, Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048, Sunwoo (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106332).. Intergenic, single exon transcript. One transcriptional start site, long isoform is a continuation of the short isoform (Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048).
NEAT1	MEN epsilon/beta, VINC, TncRNA, linc1317	Expression	Expressed in a wide range of human and mouse tissues (Peyman (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9858482, Saha (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16760401, Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048, Sunwoo (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106332). Although expression of the long isoform (Neat1 v2/ Men beta) is much lower than Neat1 v1/ Men epsilon in many tissues (Nakagawa (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21444682).. Up-regulation of Neat1 (and subsequent formation of/increase in paraspeckles) may be a general feature of differentiation. Neat1 is up-regulated upon human ESC differentiation (Chen (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19716791), muscle differentiation (Sunwoo (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106332) and in-vitro neuronal differentiation (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068).. Up-regulated upon infection of mice with Japanese encephalitis virus or Rabies virus (Saha (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16760401).. Expressed in the nucleus accumbens of normal human brains and upregulated in this brain region in heroin abusers (Michelhaugh (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21128942). In addition, expression levels are elevated in the caudate nucleus of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative condition, Huntington's disease (Johnson (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22202438).. Localised to paraspeckles within the nucleus (Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048, Sunwoo (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106332).. Mouse Neat1 found to be highly unstable (half-life <2 hr) in N2A (neuroblastoma) and 3T3 cells, although low stability did not prevent paraspeckle formation (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755), while human NEAT1 appears to be more stable (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Sasaki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19188602, Sunwoo (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106332). The two Neat1 isoforms also have differing stability, with the long (v2/Men beta) isoform more stable than than the shorter (v1/Men epsilon) isoform in N2A and 3T3 cells (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
NEAT1	MEN epsilon/beta, VINC, TncRNA, linc1317	Function	Transcription of Neat1 is essential for the assembly, maintenance and structural integrity of paraspeckles (Clemson (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19217333, Sasaki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19188602, Sunwoo (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106332, Mao (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21170033).. Newly transcribed Neat1 RNA nucleates the formation of paraspeckles at its transcription site, recruiting paraspeckle proteins. Continued expression is required to maintain paraspeckles, identifying the dynamic nature of this nuclear body (Mao (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21170033).. Literature currently provides conflicting evidence about whether Neat1 v1 is sufficient for the formation of paraspeckles, or if this requires full length Neat1 v2 (Sasaki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19188602, (Shevtsov (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21240286). In vivo however, significant expression of Neat1 v2 appears to be required for cells to form more than 1 or 2 paraspeckles (Nakagawa (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21444682).. Neat1 appears to constrain the size and mediate the cylindrical geometry of paraspeckles. Neat1 short and the identical 5' end of Neat1 long plus the 3' of Neat1 long all localise to the periphery of paraspeckles, while the central region of Neat1 long is found in the interior of the nuclear body (Souquere (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20881053).. Interacts with paraspeckles proteins PSPC1, PSF/SFPQ and NONO/P54NRB either directly or in a complex (Clemson (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19217333, Sasaki (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19188602, Sunwoo (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106332).. Interaction of short isoform with p54 requires protein interaction regions near the 5' and 3' of the transcript (Murthy (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211624).. Neat1 knockout lead to loss of paraspeckles, however mice were viable and fertile with normal morphology and populations of differentiated cells in one Neat1 v1 and v2 expressing tissue tested (Nakagawa (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21444682).. Neat1 has also been reported to interact with a number of chromatin binding protein/complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells including PRC1, PRC2,	JARID1B, ESET	and SUV39H1, with the general pattern being interaction with repressors of gene expression (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018)
NEAT1	MEN epsilon/beta, VINC, TncRNA, linc1317	Conservation	Placental mammals. Dog Neat1 is found in several genomic locations, version that is found near single dog Malat1 gene is given below (Hutchinson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17270048). 
NEAT1	MEN epsilon/beta, VINC, TncRNA, linc1317	Misc	A conserved tRNA like sequence at the 3' end is cleaved off and processed to generate a short tRNA-like ncRNA from the long (Men beta) transcript, similar to Malat1 (Sunwoo (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106332).. The last ~500bp of the short (Men epsilon) isoform has been shown to be expressed in trophoblast cells with a function potentially independent from the Neat1 transcript. This transcript, TncRNA has its own entry.
NEAT1	MEN epsilon/beta, VINC, TncRNA, linc1317	Name	Neat1: Nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1. Short isoform - Neat1 v1. Long isoform - Neat1 v2. Multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1). Short isoform - MEN epsilon. Long isoform - MEN beta. . VINC:  Virus-inducible ncRNA
Nespas	Gnas-as, GNAS antisense transcript, GNAS1as, SANG	Characteristics	Northern blot with a probe for Nespas detects a smear and discrete band of 4.4kb and larger (Wroe (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10716699). In addition to an unspliced form, five alternatively spliced forms of up to 1.4 kb in length have also been detected (Williamson (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11889554).. Imprinted (transcribed from the paternal allele). Transcribed from intron 2 of Nesp (Gnas), encompassing exons 2 through 1. The imprinted GNAS locus encodes the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein as well as additional imprinted transcripts including the maternally expressed NESP55 and other paternally expressed transcripts (XLalphas and A/B transcripts).
Nespas	Gnas-as, GNAS antisense transcript, GNAS1as, SANG	Expression	Tissue-specific expression with signal in heart, in cerebral cortex, adrenal, and spleen, where Nesp is also expressed. Nesp and Nespas transcripts show expression from opposite parental alleles in most (but not all) tissues (Li (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11056047), and Nespas may be abundant in some tissues where Nesp is not detected (Williamson (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11889554). Furthermore, the Nesp transcripts can also remain imprinted in tissues that lack Nespas.
Nespas	Gnas-as, GNAS antisense transcript, GNAS1as, SANG	Function	A 4.2 kb microdeletion in humans that ablates two GNAS antisense exons is associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib.  When maternally transmitted, this mutation causes loss of maternal GNAS imprints, partial gain of NESP55 methylation, and resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) in affected and obligate carrier individuals. Paternal transmission leads to epigenetic alterations in cis, including a partial loss of NESP55 methylation and a partial gain of A/B methylation. (Chillambhi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20444925). Nespas RNA was identified as binding to the repressive PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting that like noncoding RNAs from other imprinted region, nespas could act to regulate the imprinting cluster it is transcribed from (Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659).

npc48	npcRNA 48	Characteristics	983 nucleotides, unspliced. Contain regions that display significant Z-score values for potential secondary structures, which span > 8% of its total length (Hirsch (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16500993).
npc48	npcRNA 48	Expression	Broadly expressed in all tissues analyzed (roots, rosettes, stems, inflorescences, etc) (Hirsch (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16500993).
npc48	npcRNA 48	Function	Overexpression of npc48 in Arabidopsis thaliana led to strong leaf serration (a symptom of defects in cell proliferation along the margins of leaf primordia). Plants overexpressing npc48 showed other drastic developmental anomalies, including an increase in the rosette diameter and a delay in flowering time compared with wild-type plants.. The phenotype of npc48-over-expressing plants resembles that of plants over-expressing MIR168, which have reduced levels of the miR168 AGO1 target, and of AGO1-sensitive miRNAs such as miR166. They also show decreased miR166 accumulation, but presence of AGO1 mRNA and miR168 at wild-type levels.. In addition, npc48 plants exhibited reduced accumulation of miR164, suggesting that npc48 could regulate a subset of miRNAs. Interestingly, mir164a mutants also display abnormal serrations of the leaf margins, which are milder than the serrations induced by overexpression of npc48, suggesting that the reduction in miR164 alone cannot account for the phenotype.. Over-expression of npc48 did not have a general effect on miRNAs or AGO1 accumulation (Ben Amor (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997003).
npc536	npcRNA 536	Characteristics	597 nucleotides, unspliced. Sequence from full-length cDNA clone GSLTSIL78ZH02 is 645 bp-long.. Npc536 transcript is antisense to the AT1G67930 mRNA (encoding a Golgi-transport complex related protein) (Ben Amor (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997003).
npc536	npcRNA 536	Expression	npc536 has a large dynamic range of expression across a wide range of tissues and hormonal, biotic, or abiotic treatments.. Up-regulated in roots and leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana plants submitted to stress by phosphate starvation and salt (NaCl) stress (Ben Amor (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997003).
npc536	npcRNA 536	Function	Transformed plants over-expressing npc536 showed heightened root growth under salt stress conditions, with increased primary root growth and secondary root length.. No phenotype could be observed in mutants that carry T-DNA insertions within npc536.. In response to certain abiotic stresses such as drought or cold treatment, the root expression of these two genes (AT1G67930 and npc536) tends to be anti-correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.636 and -0.983, respectively). However, accumulation of the AT1G67930 transcript was not significantly modified in plants over-expressing npc536 or in npc536 mutants (Ben Amor (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997003).
npc536	npcRNA 536	Misc	Annotated as AT1G67920 hypothetical protein, Gene ID: 843120, in Genbank, and contains a small ORF conserved in rice (Ben Amor (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997003). The 'hypothetical protein' is 67 aa.
NRON	None known	Characteristics	noncoding repressor of NFAT (NRON). ~2.7 kb. Composed of three exons, which can be alternatively spliced to yield transcripts ranging in size from 0.8 to 3.7 kb.
NRON	None known	Expression	Expressed in relatively low levels. Present in mouse embryos and enriched in cells derived from human and mouse placenta, muscle, and lymphoid tissues such as the spleen, thymus and lymph nodes, with differential expression of isoforms.
NRON	None known	Function	Identified in a shRNA knock down screening for conserved long noncoding RNAs that modulate the activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).. Knockdown of human or mouse NRON sequences in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells or mouse 3T3 and Jurkat cell lines resulted in significantly increased NFAT activity.. Knockdown of NRON increases NFAT transcription factor activity by specifically affecting NFAT nuclear trafficking. This effect is observed on the activity of multiple NFAT family members (NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, and NFATc4).. Using an RNA-protein affinity purification strategy with part of NRON sequence, 11 proteins were reported to putatively bind NRON. These included: calmodulin-binding protein (IQGAP1), a nuclear transport factor (KPNB1), the structural subunit of a phosphatase (PPP2R1A), a component of the proteasome (PSMD11) and an RNA helicase (DDX3X); as well as three members of the importin-beta superfamily, factors which mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of cargoes such as NFAT. Direct interaction was demonstrated with importin-beta 1 (KPNB1).. In summary, having a repressive effect on NFAT signaling, NRON is proposed to regulate NFAT's subcellular localization as an RNA component of a protein complex that acts to represses NFAT activity.. It has presumed implications in immune response and developmental processes regulated by NFAT.
NRON	None known	Conservation	NRON contains blocks of sequence which are highly conserved back to chicken. In particular, it contains two large regions of 300 to 400 bases regions of near-perfect sequence conservation between rodents and primates.
NTT	None known	Characteristics	17kb, polyadenylated, but not spliced. . Sense intronic to Phosphodiesterase 7B, also covers one exon.. Contains a number of repeats, mostly near the 3 end.
NTT	None known	Expression	Expressed in activated, but not resting, CD4+ T cells. Also found in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD8+ T cells.. Localisation is predominately nuclear.. Shows a similar expression pattern to the interferon-gamma receptor gene, found ~1Mb away, which may suggest a co-regulation of the two transcripts in immune cell activation/development.
NTT	None known	Conservation	Has short regions of conserved sequence.
NTT	None known	Misc	Phosphodiesterase 7B is a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, a member of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase family. Involved in cAMP and cGMP signaling.. Sequence given is from genomic DNA, which corresponded to results from RT-PCR and RACE.

Otx2os1	OTX2-AS1	Expression	Expression restricted to retina in panel of adult tissues (retina also shows the highest expression of Otx2).. Otx2 and Otx2os1 had a partially complementary expression pattern in adult retinal layers. Otx2 was predominately expressed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and into the inner nuclear layer (INL), while Otx2os was predominately expressed in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and into the INL.
Otx2os1	OTX2-AS1	Conservation	Low conservation between mouse and human transcripts.
Otx2os1	OTX2-AS1	Misc	Otx2 is a transcription factor involved in brain and eye development.. Otx2os1 Mouse: GeneID: 606497.  Human GeneID: 100309464
Otx2os1	OTX2-AS1	Name	Otx2os1: OTX2 opposite strand transcript 1

p53 mRNA	None known	Misc	p53 is a key tumour suppressor gene which "responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157". MDM2 is an important regulator of p53, with binding of MDM2 protein to p53 protein promoting p53 degradation.

PANDA	P21 associated ncRNA DNA damage activated
PANDA antisense RNA	Expression	One of five lncRNAs surrounding the transcription start site of the cell cycle gene CDKN1A that, along with the CDKN1A protein coding gene, were induced in human fetal lung fibroblasts upon DNA damage by doxorubicin.. Induced up to 40 fold upon DNA damage peaking 16 h after doxorubicin treatment, a much greater response than shown by CDKN1A.. Expression of PANDA and CDKN1A were positively regulated by p53. CDKN1A did not induce PANDA.
PANDA	P21 associated ncRNA DNA damage activated
PANDA antisense RNA	Function	P53 effector gene, acts in response to DNA damage to limit apoptosis while CDKN1A induces cell cycle arrest.. Loss of PANDA leads to the apoptosis of doxorubicin treated cells.. Loss of PANDA affected the expression of many genes during the DNA damage response.  Upregulated genes were enriched for those involved in apoptosis, including the apoptotic activators APAF1, BIK, FAS and LRDD. Leading to apoptosis of doxorubicin treated cells.. Cell death genes downstream of p53 are known to have NF-YA binding sites. PANDA RNA interacts with the transcription factor NF-YA and attenuates its occupany of target gene promoters.
PANDA	P21 associated ncRNA DNA damage activated
PANDA antisense RNA	Conservation	Syntenic sequence appear to be present in apes and old world monkeys (the Catarrhini).

PDZK1IP1-AS1	Noncoding RNA activating4: ncRNA-a4, PDZK1IP1 antisense RNA 1
	Characteristics	Spliced, two exon 661nt transcript.. Transcribed bidirectionally with CYP4A22-AS1 - http://www.lncrnadb.org/Detail.aspx?TKeyID=275.. LincRNA catalogue from deep RNA sequencing suggests variation in transcript length and also potential alternative splicing (Cabili (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21890647).. Expressed downstream of TAL1 and PDZK1IP1 on the opposite strand.. In-vitro translation showed no sign of protein product.
PDZK1IP1-AS1	Noncoding RNA activating4: ncRNA-a4, PDZK1IP1 antisense RNA 1
	Expression	Expressed in Jurkat cells, but not in MCF7 cells (unlike CYP4A22-AS1).
PDZK1IP1-AS1	Noncoding RNA activating4: ncRNA-a4, PDZK1IP1 antisense RNA 1
	Function	PDZK1IP1-AS1 expression appears to stimulate CMPK1 gene expression (in Jurkat cells). A gene located over 150 kb 3â of PDZK1IP1-AS1 on the same strand. 
PHO5 lncRNA	PHO5as	Characteristics	~2.4kb. Appears to be antisense. Covers PHO5 gene region and promoter.
PHO5 lncRNA	PHO5as	Expression	Expressed during high phosphate conditions when PHO5 is repressed.. Transcript degraded by the exosome and accumulates in exosome mutants.
PHO5 lncRNA	PHO5as	Function	LncRNA transcription involved in remodeling the PHO5 promoter and activation of the gene.. Loss of ncRNA transcription delayed nucleosome eviction and RNA polymerase II recruitment to the PHO5 promoter, showing it was necessary for proper activation.. Note: shows that transcription which generates short lived/ exosome degraded transcripts can be functionally relevant. Although it not known if the transcript itself is functional.
PHO5 lncRNA	PHO5as	Misc	The PHO5 gene encodes a protein involved in phosphate metabolism that is repressed under high phosphate conditions and activated under phosphate starvation.
PHO84 antisense	None known	Characteristics	Antisense to PHO84.. 2 transcripts, one covers the entire PHO84 gene, the other is longer and extends into the YML122C (a short hypothetical ORF) locus. Both initiate transcription near the 3' of PHO84. 
PHO84 antisense	None known	Expression	There was low expression of antisense transcripts constitutively but abundance increased in aged cells as PHO84 was silenced.. PHO84 antisense transcripts are degraded by the exosome, but increased in abundance in aged cells due to transcript stabilisation. 
PHO84 antisense	None known	Function	Summary: Silences PHO84 in aged cells. In aged cells exosome dissociates from PHO84 locus allowing the stabilisation and accumulation of PHO84 antisense transcripts.. Antisense RNAs recruit the histone deacetylase complex (Hda1, Hda2, Hda3) to the PHO84 locus, causing deacetylation and PHO84 silencing.. Blocking expression of full length PHO84 antisense transcripts prevented PHO84 silencing, demonstrating the antisense transcripts (not just transcription) was necessary for silencing. . Nb: not clear if PHO84 antisense binds HDAC complex directly.
PHO84 antisense	None known	Misc	PHO84 is an inorganic phosphate transporter
PINC	None known	Characteristics	~1 and 1.6 kb isoforms identified.
PINC	None known	Expression	Developmentally regulated (Ginger (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574773). Expressed in alveolar structures of the mammary gland and induced by pregnancy and hormonal stimulation (Ginger (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11682629). Also present in testis, liver and heart. Different isoforms show a tissue-specific distribution.. Isoforms localise in distinct foci predominantly in the cytoplasm or nucleus depending on stage of cell cycle (Ginger (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574773).
PINC	None known	Function	siRNA knock-down experiments indicate that PINC RNA performs dual roles in cell survival and regulation of cell-cycle progression (Ginger (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574773).
PINC	None known	Conservation	PINC identified in rodents. Other mammals contains several conserved sequence blocks (Ginger (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574773). However, it is unclear if a PINC homologue exists in these species, for example the syntenic human locus is antisense to the 3' of DIRC3 and no sense RNAs have been identified which contain the conserved sequence blocks.
Pinci1 family RNAs	None known	Name	Pinci1: P. infestans non-coding infection-specific family
Pinci1 family RNAs	None known	Characteristics	Analysis of a member (Pinci1-1) indicates a minimum size of 850 bases. Polyadenylated.. The described Pinci1 RNA family comprises more than 400 members with sequence homolgy (110 full-length and 297 single-domain homology), which are arranged in clusters of up to nine copies throughout the P. infestans genome.
Pinci1 family RNAs	None known	Expression	Identified in a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) screen for exprressed sequences upregulated during Phytophthora infestans of potato.. Expression of members of five classes of Pinci1 transcripts was found markedly upregulated from 12 to 33h post-inoculation of potato with P. infestans, a period defining the biotrophic phase of the infection.
Pldi	None known	Characteristics	~850nuc, alternatively spliced 2 or 3 exon transcript.. Evolution of a lncRNA gene from an intergenic region.. Has an overlapping antisense transcript.
Pldi	None known	Expression	Expressed in postmeiotic cells in the testis.. May regulate the expression levels of other genes in testis. 
Pldi	None known	Function	Knockout showed reduced sperm motility and reduced testis weight.
Pldi	None known	Conservation	Gene is specific to certain Mus species. Intergenic region is present in other mammals (rat, human) and other more basal Mus species but no transcripts are expressed showing evolution of this gene in the past 2.5-3.5 million years.. Splice and polyA sites utilised by Pldi were present as crytpic sites in other mouse species, mutations in the 5' regulatory region of Pldi appear to have allowed its expression, which has subsequently been selected for. 
Pldi	None known	Name	Pldi: Polymorphic derived intron containing ncRNA
PR antisense transcripts	AT1, AT2, AT3	Characteristics	Found several antisense transcripts which initiate in the progesterone receptor (PR) promoter region. . AT1 and AT3 were unspliced.. AT2-T47D and AT2-MCF7 were spliced with seven exons and transcribed over a 70kb region. AT2 isoforms initiated between the PR A and B start sites, had different (cell line specific) start sites but were otherwise identical. . AT2-T47D ~1.35kb. AT2-MCF7 ~1.5kb.
PR antisense transcripts	AT1, AT2, AT3	Expression	Expression identified in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D).. AT2 isoforms were the most highly expressed antisense transcripts.. AT2 isoforms could be detected in the nucleus.
PR antisense transcripts	AT1, AT2, AT3	Function	All function characterisation was on the AT2 isoforms.. PR antisense transcripts act as a scaffold for other RNAs and proteins to bind, allowing them to regulate transcription of the progesterone receptor.. Different small RNAs targeted at PR antisense transcripts can activate or repress PR transcription. A PR antisense transcript was necessary for activating PR transcription via a small RNA.. PR antisense transcripts could associate with small RNAs, Argonaute proteins and hnRNP-k to bring about regulation of the PR protein coding gene. 
PR antisense transcripts	AT1, AT2, AT3	Name	Progesterone receptor promoter antisense transcripts
PR antisense transcripts	AT1, AT2, AT3	Misc	Accessions:. AT-1: FJ515871. AT-2-MCF7: FJ515872. AT-2-T47D: FJ515873.  
PRINS	None known	Characteristics	~3.6 kb, transcribed by RNA Polymerase II; spliced (2 exons) and polyadenylated (Sonkoly (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855153).
PRINS	None known	Expression	Elevated expression in psoriatic epidermis. Regulated by the proliferation and differentiation state of keratinocytes (Sonkoly (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855153).. Expressed at different levels in various human tissues, with highest levels detected in veins (Sonkoly (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855153).. Several stress signals such as ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation, viral infection (herpes simplex virus), and translational inhibition increased the RNA level of PRINS (Sonkoly (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855153), as well as HaCaT keratinocyte cell treatment with microbial agents such as bacteria peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and wall extract (Bari (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21750967). 
PRINS	None known	Function	siRNA knock-down shows that PRINS is required for cell viability after serum starvation (Sonkoly (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855153), and also alters cell morphology and gene expression (Szegedi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20377629).. Elevated PRINS expression in the epidermis is suggested to contribute to psoriasis susceptibility (Sonkoly (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855153).. In keratinocytes PRINS regulates the expression of the G1P3 gene, an anti-apoptotic protein that is overexpressed in psoriasis (Szegedi (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20377629), although the mechanism is unknown. 
PRINS	None known	Name	Psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA Gene Induced by Stress (PRINS)
PRINS	None known	Misc	PRINS RNA contains contains two Alu elements, as well as a short sequence stretch with ~70% similarity to an element in a small cytoplasmic noncoding RNA, named G8, from Tetrahymena thermophila, whose expression responds to heat shock and is involved in thermotolerance (Sonkoly (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855153).
Prion-associated RNAs	None known		Annotation in Progress. [[. RNAs of unknown identity associate with prion protein PrP, and participate in the conversion of human cellular PrP to its altered infectious conformation.. ]]
pRNA	IGS RNAs, intergenic nc-rRNA	Characteristics	Originate from the intergenic spacers (IGS) that separate rRNA genes (Rungger (1979) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/291055, Morgan (1983) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6579535).. Like rRNA genes, spacers also contain polymerase I promoters and the ~2kb from the spacer promoter to the rRNA gene promoter is transcribed (Kuhn (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3428263). These long lncRNAs must be processed to create the a shorter ~150-300 nt RNA sequence(s), pRNAs, from just upstream of the rRNA promoter that bind TIP5 (the large subunit of the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC) (Mayer (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678107).. In human cells transcription runs from ~1kb upstream of the rRNA transcriptional start site to over 200bp into the gene (Shiao (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19838300). 
pRNA	IGS RNAs, intergenic nc-rRNA	Expression	Nuclear localised (Mayer (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678107).. Expression of IGS sequences is regulated by the cell cycle with expression up-regulated in mid-S phase. There are many rRNA repeats and only a subset these express IGS sequences (Santoro (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010804).. Expression in human lung cancer cell lines was generally higher than in a non-transformed lung cell line, with a negative correlation between the intergenic nc-rRNA and the 45s rRNA precursor transcript (Shiao (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19838300). Investigation of intergenic nc-rRNA SNPs also identified one that correlated with lower expression of the intergenic nc-rRNA (Shiao (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19838300).
pRNA	IGS RNAs, intergenic nc-rRNA	Function	Required for the nucleolar localization of NoRC and epigenetic control of the rDNA locus (Mayer (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678107).. Details:. Conserved stem-loop structure binds to the TIP5 protein in the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC (Mayer (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678107, Mayer (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18600236). This binding is controlled by the acetylation state of TIP5, with IGS RNA binding the de-acetylated version TIP5 (Zhou (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19578370).. Required for nucleolar localization of NoRC, recruitment of NoRC to chromatin, and subsequent addition of repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation at the rRNA gene promoter (Mayer (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678107). . Without IGS RNA, NoRC regulation is lost and rRNA expression is increased (Mayer (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678107). . pRNAs processed by IGS sequences can function in-trans, suggesting they could silence the rRNA genes they originate from or other rRNA gene clusters (Santoro (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010804).
pRNA	IGS RNAs, intergenic nc-rRNA	Conservation	Expressed IGS sequences are found in widely diverged species ie: Xenopus, Drosophila and mouse (Rungger (1979) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/291055, Miller (1983) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6306560, Kuhn (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3428263), but may not carry out the same function.. In mammals the functional IGS sequences are poorly conserved at the nucleotide level but fold into similar stem-loop secondary structures (Mayer (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18600236). 
pRNA	IGS RNAs, intergenic nc-rRNA	Misc	The actual rRNA gene loci that express IGS and pRNAs have not been catalogued.
PSF inhibiting RNA	None known	Characteristics	Transcript not characterised, RNA fragment maps to repeat rich intergenic region.
PSF inhibiting RNA	None known	Expression	Specifically expressed in melanoma cell lines (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).
PSF inhibiting RNA	None known	Function	Fragment from PSF inhibiting RNA was found to bind hPSF, could release it from GAGE6 proto-oncogene regulatory DNA in-vitro and in-vivo (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).. Expression caused increased colony formation in culture and a modest increase in tumour formation in mice (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).. Suggests PSF inhibiting RNA has oncogenic activity by repressing the hPSF tumour suppressor (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).
PSF inhibiting RNA	None known	Conservation	Only studied in human cells.
PSF inhibiting RNA	None known	Misc	Referred to as "unidentified RNA fragment/gene" in Li et al paper.
psvA antisense RNA	None known	Characteristics	1.8 kb, cis-antisense to the pre-spore gene psvA, initiated from a promoter located within the translated region of the psvA gene.
psvA antisense RNA	None known	Expression	Exhibits a temporal expression inverse to psvA during development.
psvA antisense RNA	None known	Function	Excess transcription of antisense RNA in vegetative cells and after disaggregation suggests its involvement in the control of psvA RNA levels. This has been suggested to operate at the control of mRNA stability, given that inhibition of RNA synthesis during disaggregation prevented destabilization of the psvA mRNA.
PTENP1	None known	Name	PTENP1: PTEN Pseudogene 1
PTENP1	None known	Characteristics	Processed pseudogene of PTEN tumour suppressor gene at 9p13.3.. ~3.9kb.. PTENP1 "coding sequence" quite similar to PTEN but has lost start codon, while 3'UTR is ~1kb shorter than PTEN. Part of the PTENP1 3'UTR sequence is highly conserved compared to PTEN (~95%) with seed matches to the same miRNAs.
PTENP1	None known	Expression	Expressed in a very wide variety of human tissues and in prostate cancer. Good correlation between PTENP1 and PTEN levels.. Inhibition of endogenous miRNAs with seed matches to PTEN and PTENP1 leads to an increase in PTENP1 expression, validating it is targeted by miRNAs known to repress PTEN. 
PTENP1	None known	Function	Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). PTENP1, through its 3'UTR, acts as a decoy for miRNAs that target PTEN.. PTNEP1 functions as a tumour suppressor gene.. Overexpression of the PTENP1 3'UTR lead to an increased level of PTEN and cellular growth inhibition, an effect dependent on the presence of mature miRNAs, supporting PTENP1's role as a miRNA decoy. While knockdown of PTENP1 lead to a decrease in PTEN levels and faster cell growth.. The PTENP1 locus was lost in a subset of colon cancers and a relationship was reported between PTENP1 copy number and PTEN expression level.
PTENP1	None known	Misc	Cells are very sensitive to levels of PTEN, with even subtle changes influencing cancer susceptibility (Alimonti (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400965).. A wider role for pseudogenes as miRNA decoys has been proposed.
PWR1	None known	Characteristics	~1.2kb capped, polyadenylated, single exon transcript.. PWR1 expressed in FLO11 regulatory region.. Expressed on opposite strand to FLO11. Starts within a region covered by a second lncRNA ICR1 - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Default.aspx?TKeyid=235, transcribed in antisense direction to ICR1 and terminates around the area of ICR1 initiation.
PWR1	None known	Expression	Expression of ICR1 and PWR1 is inversely correlated. . ICR1 expression requires the Sfl1 transcription factor known to repress FLO11 and is repressed by the Flo8 transcription factor and the Rpd3L histone deacetylase (HDAC).. PWR1 expression requires Rpd3L HDAC and Flo8 and is repressed by Sfl1.
PWR1	None known	Function	PWR1 regulates expression of the FLO11/MUC1 gene in cis, in conjunction with a second lncRNA ICR1 - http://www.lncrnadb.com/Default.aspx?TKeyid=235.. Expression of ICR1 represses expression of FLO11, probably by promoter occlusion. . Expression of ICR1 is repressed by PWR1 (again probably by promoter occlusion in cis), allowing expression of FLO11, so the regulatory circuit depends on whether PWR1 is expressed or repressed.. ICR1 is lowly expressed constitutively and competition between Flo8 and Sfl1 transcription factors determines which ncRNA is expressed and therefore if FLO11 is on or off.
PWR1	None known	Misc	FLO11/ MUC1 - cell surface glycoprotein that controls cell-cell adhesion and shows variegated expression in a clonal population of yeast cells (ie: expressed at high levels in some cells, silenced in others).. Sequence of PWR1 is found on chromosome IX from coordinates 395996 to 396936. See. http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?sgdid=S000132614
PWR1	None known	Name	PWR1: promoting Watson RNA1 
RepA transcript	None known	Characteristics	~1.6 kb transcript containing the RepA repeats (Zhao (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974356). Repeats are internal to Xist, near the 5' end (Wutz (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11780141). . The RepA repeat sequence is expressed as part of full length Xist and as part of the shorter RepA transcript.. RepA repeats: 7.5 repeat units separated by spacers. Each repeat forms 2 stem loops (Wutz (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11780141).
RepA transcript	None known	Expression	RepA transcript is expressed prior to the onset of X-inactivation (Zhao (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974356).
RepA transcript	None known	Function	RepA repeats are required for X-chromosome silencing but not for localisation of Xist to the X-chromosome (Wutz (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11780141).  . The repA transcript recruits polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) to the inactive X chromosome, with Ezh2 serving as the RNA binding subunit (Zhao (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974356, Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659).. Recruitment of PRC2 by the RepA transcript allows deposition of HE-K27me3 marks at the Xist locus which is needed for up-regulation of full length Xist. Suggests the RepA transcript is necessary for the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (Zhao (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974356).
RepA transcript	None known	Conservation	Sequence at 5' of Xist containing the A repeats and from where the separate RepA transcript is expressed show conservation throughout placental mammals.
Rian	Irm, MEG8 and Bsr, linc1458	Characteristics	These overlapping but non-identical transcripts are found in the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted region (Hatada (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481034, Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654, Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500) and should probably be viewed as different isoforms of the Rian gene. The human and mouse loci are quite similar, whereas the rat loci (Bsr gene) has undergone significant divergence and so has its own entry in the database.. Spliced lncRNAs that contain a number of intronic snoRNAs and sometimes miRNAs (CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206, Royo (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507654, Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500). . In human and mouse, transcription of the Meg8 isoform can extend through the snoRNA clusters. Mouse Meg8 is ~4.4kb with over 20 exons. In mouse the ~2.5 kb Irm transcript contains the last 10 exons of Meg8 but has its own transcriptional start site. Mouse Meg8 contains intronic miRNAs not found in Irm (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).. RNA sequencing confirms a large number of isoforms with alternative splicing and also retained introns exist at this locus though no evidence was found for Rian overlapping the Meg9/Mirg transcript (Guttman (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20436462). It is unclear if the Irm isoform exists in humans.
Rian	Irm, MEG8 and Bsr, linc1458	Expression	Imprinted: Maternally expressed (Hatada (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481034, Charlier (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11337479, CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206).. Expressed predominately in brain (Hatada (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481034), embryo and muscle (Charlier (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11337479) with generally weak expression in other tissues (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500). Expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018). In mouse the longer 'Meg8' transcript is also expressed in skin whereas the shorter 3' 'Irm' is not (Hagan (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19194500).. Up-regulated during differentiation of neuronal progenitors to GABAergic neurons in vitro (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068).. Localised to the nucleus (Hatada (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481034).. Intronic snoRNAs also show brain and embryo imprinted expression (CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206).
Rian	Irm, MEG8 and Bsr, linc1458	Function	LncRNAs contain a number of miRNAs and snoRNAs, little is known about the molecular function of the lncRNAs.. Rian transcript(s) bind to the PRC2 chromatin modifying complex in mouse embryonic stem cells (Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659, Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018). Rian was also found to interact with a number of other chromatin binding protein(s)/complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells including PRC1, JARID1B, JARID1C and CBX3, with the general pattern being interaction with repressors of gene expression (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018).. Aberrant repression of Rian and other maternally expressed lncRNAs from the DLK1-Dio3 imprinting cluster is present in most induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and is responsible for the failure of iPSCs to form viable mice, with embryos dying mid-gestation (Stadtfeld (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418860).
Rian	Irm, MEG8 and Bsr, linc1458	Conservation	Bsr and Rian/MEG8/Irm are not highly conserved between species (CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206). However, some Rian exons show good homology to Bsr and while many snoRNAs are specific to one species others are homologous (Hatada (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481034, CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206).. Rian gene is present in mammals.
Rian	Irm, MEG8 and Bsr, linc1458	Name	Rian: RNA Imprinted and Accumulated in Nucleus . Irm: Imprinted RNA near Meg3/Gtl2. MEG8: Maternally expressed gene 8
Rian	Irm, MEG8 and Bsr, linc1458	Summary	Comparing human, mouse and rat: All contain ncRNA gene(s) with intronic snoRNAs at this locus. The snoRNAs vary between species, but there are some homologous snoRNAs between each suggesting an evolutionary history with species specific snoRNA addition and duplication (CavaillÃ© (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12045206).. The expression profiles of Bsr, Rian/Irm/MEG8 and the snoRNAs they contain are similar between rat, human and mouse.
Rian	Irm, MEG8 and Bsr, linc1458	Misc	Human UCSC browser link below is for Refseq Meg8, however it is clear from known human mRNAs that transcripts from the Meg8 locus can extend much further than the current Refseq annotation.
Rmst	Dmt2 (Dorso-medial telencephalon gene 2)	Characteristics	Several isoforms of ~1.4, ~2 and ~3kb identified (Uhde (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20062813). Has splice variants, multiple alternative promoters (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).. Intergenic, transcription start site contains a HeK4me3 locus (Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288).
Rmst	Dmt2 (Dorso-medial telencephalon gene 2)	Expression	Expressed in specific regions of embryonic and post-natal mouse brain (see Chodroff (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624288 and Uhde (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20062813 for details).  . Expression in embryonic brain includes in â ventral midbrain where dopaminergic neurons are formedâ (Uhde (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20062813). So Rmst may be a marker for developing dopaminergic neurons (Uhde (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20062813).. 2kb transcript also expressed in adult brain, eye and lowly expressed in muscle and ovary (Uhde (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20062813).. Transcript found to be highly unstable with a half-life <2 hr in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
RNCR3	A930011O12Rik, LOC157627	Characteristics	Intergenic, four exon transcript in mouse.. Gene contains a highly expressed, brain specific microRNA (mir124a-1) in an exon (Lagos-Quintana (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12007417).
RNCR3	A930011O12Rik, LOC157627	Expression	Dynamic expression in mouse retinal development (Blackshaw (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823).. Expressed throughout adult mouse brain with enriched expression in hippocampus subfields,  Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum and the mitral layer of the olfactory bulb (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068).. Up-regulated during differentiation of GABAergic neurons in culture but downregulated during oligodendrocyte differentiation (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068). 
RNCR3	A930011O12Rik, LOC157627	Conservation	LncRNA is conserved in mammals and overlaps the LOC157627 noncoding Refseq gene in humans (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068).
RNCR3	A930011O12Rik, LOC157627	Misc	Oct4, Nanog transcription factors are reported to bind to locus (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780). 
RNCR3	A930011O12Rik, LOC157627	Name	RNCR3: Retinal noncoding RNA 3
rncs-1	None known	Characteristics	847 bases. Spliced and polyadenylated. Highly structured, with an almost perfectly double-stranded helix of ~300 nuc.. Expressed from F55A4.9 noncoding RNA gene.
rncs-1	None known	Expression	Transcript is enriched in males. Detected in all developmental stages tested (embryos, larval stages (L1-L4), and young adults). Spacial expression localized to intestine (robustly detected in E cell lineage of midgut from 28-cell stage to adulthood), as well as to hypodermis (starting by the comma stage, including Hyp7 syncytium and head and tail hypodermis).. RNA has higher expression in arrested L1s, and dauer larvae purified from exhausted liquid culture, by transcriptional modulation in response to food supply (induced by starvation).
rncs-1	None known	Function	Forms extensive double-stranded RNA structures and inhibits Dicer cleavage of other dsRNA in-vitro, although rncs-1 itself is not a substrate for Dicer (because of branched structures at its termini). Expression of rncs-1 reduces Dicer-generated siRNA, and affects levels of Dicer-regulated genes (5 identified genes).. Lines overexpressing rncs-1 may result in increased frequency of males among hermaphrodite self-progeny.
rncs-1	None known	Conservation	Absence of an identifiable rncs-1 homolog in closely related Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis remanei species.
rncs-1	None known	Misc	Functional analogy is drawn with certain viruses dsRNA expressed to compete with cellular dsRNA-mediated pathways, such as VAI adenovirus RNA (McKenna (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16580685).. It is a substrate of ADAR deamination.
rncs-1	None known	Name	rncs-1: RNA noncoding, starvation up-regulated 1
roX1 and roX2	None known	Characteristics	rox1 and 2 are two X-linked genes. The primary and secondary structures of roX RNAs, including splice variants, are important for their function.
roX1 and roX2	None known	Expression	RNAs are male-specific.. RNAs are retained in the nucleus.. Expression is developmentally regulated in Drosophila male embryos. roX1 is specifically expressed in males from mid-embryogenesis onward and roX2 from 6h of embryo development onward.
roX1 and roX2	None known	Function	RNAs are responsible for dosage compensation (DC) in Drosophila melanogaster males, directing global (but gene specific) up-regulation of transcription from the single male X-chromosome. roX1 and roX2 are essential for DC, but are functionally redundant.. The precise mechanisms by which roX RNAs direct the Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) to specific sites in the X-chromosome are still unknown. RNAs associate with Male-specific lethal (MSL) proteins (components of the multi-protein complex DCC), directing the DCC to hundreds of sites along the X chromosome to promote histone acetylation and gene-specific activation.. Mapping of roX2 binding sites along the X-chromosome showed they were coincident with the binding sites of MSL proteins, supporting the view roX2 is part of the chromatin bound complex of MSL proteins (Simon (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22143764).

RPS6KA2 antisense transcript	RPS6KA2AS	Features	Present in chr6q27 region, which is frequently involved in chromosomal rearrangements and associated with a wide range of human cancers and, thus, postulated to harbor tumor-suppressor genes.. Antisense RNA overlaps the 1st, 6th and 7th intron of the candidate tumor suppressor gene RPS6KA2 (so far reported as a tumor suppressor gene for sporadic epithelial ovarian carcinoma). Sense and antisense RNAs are detected in fetal brain RNA, but they show inverse expression in several breast cancer cell lines compared to normal breast tissue, with RPS6KA2 down-regulated in cancer and the antisense up-regulated.. Microarray data also showed that RPS6KA2 and its antisense RNA have a negative expression correlation (with a high confidence (p=0.0092) in 42 out of 59 patients (71%)).. Pair are proposed to be reciprocally regulated, and antisense RPS6KA2 is hypothesized to regulate RPS6KA2 expression in cancer. Over-expression of the antisense RNA in BT20 cells (a breast cancer cell line model) was associated with a decrease in the intracellular levels of the sense transcript, whereas knock-down of RPS6KA2 sense by RNAi in the BT20 cell line caused an increase in the level of RPS6KA2 antisense.. Antisense RNA is reported to map in two different genomic regions, and also to contain a potential ORF, potentially representing the FAM103A1 pseudogene.
RTL	TY1 CUT	Characteristics	Originally classified as a cryptic unstable transcript (CUT) but now classed as a Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript (XUT) (van Dijk (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697827). Antisense to a Ty1 retrotransposon. Transcript initiates within Ty1 and is transcribed across the TY1 LTR (long terminal repeat) promoter sequence (Berretta (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316478). . ~400 nuc. Several initiations site, main site begins +661 nuc from the start of the LTR (Berretta (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316478). . Transcribed by RNA polymerase II, polyadenylated (Berretta (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316478). 
RTL	TY1 CUT	Expression	Unstable, degraded by a cytoplasmic 5â to 3â degradation pathway including  Xrn1, Dcp1 and Dcp2 (Berretta (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316478). . Reversibly up-regulated by lithium (van Dijk (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697827)
RTL	TY1 CUT	Function	Functions in trans to silence Ty1 retrotransposon and prevent its transposition (Berretta (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316478).. Silencing requires histone deaceylation and Set1 histone methylation. Silencing causes a decrease in RNA polymerase II occupancy while TBP (TATA binding protein) is unchanged (Berretta (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316478). While silencing appears to be antagonised by H3K4me3 (van Dijk (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697827).. Case of a CUT/XUT RNA repressing a mobile element through transcriptional gene silencing (Berretta (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316478).. Nb: Currently unclear exactly how silencing is mediated by RTL
SAF	FAS-AS (FAS antisense RNA)	Characteristics	1556 bases; transcribed from the opposite strand of intron 1 of the human Fas gene.
SAF	FAS-AS (FAS antisense RNA)	Expression	Detected in several human tissues (such as heart, placenta, liver, muscle and pancreas, as well as kidney in lower levels). It was also detected in different cancer cell lines, including Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia), MES-SA (uterine carcinoma) and U-937 (Histocytic Lymphoma); moderately expressed in CA46 (Burkittâs lym- phoma), Raji (Burkittâs lymphoma) and only slightly expressed in MG-63 (osteosarcoma).
SAF	FAS-AS (FAS antisense RNA)	Function	In vitro over-expression of Saf protects cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis.. Over-expression of Saf induces alternative splicing of FAS transcripts, wherein an alternative exon overlapped by the antisense RNA is retained and non-adjacent 3' exons are skipped. This results in Fas proteins that are not able to anchor to the cell membrane, therefore regulating Fas-mediated but not TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis.
SAF	FAS-AS (FAS antisense RNA)	Conservation	Saf gene appears to be conserved among the primates and is absent in the rodents.
SatIII transcripts	None known	Characteristics	Heterogeneous sizes, up to >1.4 kb; transcribed from tandem arrays of repetitive Satellite III (SatIII) DNA in pericentromeric heterochromatin.
SatIII transcripts	None known	Expression	Induced by heat shock and a range of stresses, such as heavy metals treatment, UV-C, oxidative and hyper-osmotic stress.
SatIII transcripts	None known	Function	Can nucleate the formation of nuclear stress bodies, recruiting transcription factors and RNA processing factors (HSF1, SAF-B and SF2/ASF) to these sites (Shevtsov (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21240286).

SCA8	ATXN8OS, KLHL1AS	Expression	N/A
SCA8	ATXN8OS, KLHL1AS	Function	Ectopic expression in Drosophila induces late-onset, progressive neurodegeneration in the retina.. Predicted gene product underpinning the triplet repeat expansion-induced neurodegenerative disease Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8.. Associates with the RNA binding protein staufen.
SCA8	ATXN8OS, KLHL1AS	Conservation	KLHL1AS promoter is conserved between human and mouse. However, the mouse gene is not spliced.
SCA8	ATXN8OS, KLHL1AS	Name	Spinocerebellar ataxia 8 (SCA8) RNA. KLHL1AS: kelch-like 1 (Drosophila) antisense. ATXN8OS: ataxin 8 opposite strand
sfRNA	Flavivirus 3' structured RNA	Name	sfRNA: subgenomic flavivirus RNA
sfRNA	Flavivirus 3' structured RNA	Characteristics	0.3-0.6 kb. Derived from the 3' untranslated region of the RNA genome (gRNA) of Flaviviruses (Urosevic (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9010281).. Contains a 5'-proximal stable hairpin (nt 6 to 56), the conserved flavivirus 3'-cyclization motif (nt 413 to 420) and the 3'-terminal long stable hairpin structure (nt 440 to 523) (Lin (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15113895). The stable RNA structures, which include multiple pseudoknots (Olsthoorn (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11680841), located at the beginning of the 3' untranslated region render this RNA resistant to nucleases (Funk (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20719943, Silva (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20739539, Pijlman (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19064258).
sfRNA	Flavivirus 3' structured RNA	Expression	Present in infected tissues, such as the brain of mice after an intracerebral challenge with Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus (Urosevic (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9010281).. In infected mammalian BHK-21 cells, the viral genome was detected as early as 24 h postinfection, and sfRNA was detected as early as 28 h postinfection, at levels 0.25 to 1.5 times as abundant as the genome RNA on a molar basis between 28 and 48 h postinfection. In mosquito C6/36 cells, the genome RNA and sfRNA were present 5 days postinfection and the small RNA was 1.25 to 5.14 times as abundant as the genome (Lin (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15113895).
sfRNA	Flavivirus 3' structured RNA	Function	Required for viral cytopathicity and pathogenicity (Pijlman (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19064258).. Transfection of sfRNA and reporter assays indicated that sfRNA modulates viral translation and replication in trans (Fan (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22040380).
sfRNA	Flavivirus 3' structured RNA	Conservation	Highly conserved among Flaviviruses, with primary sequence conservation concentrated at the loop regions of the secondary structure and at 27 nucleotides immediately adjacent to the 5' side of the structure (Brinton (1986) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3016981)
sfRNA	Flavivirus 3' structured RNA	Misc	sfRNA subgenomic fragments result from incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the host 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1 (Silva (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20739539).
Six3os	RNCR1	Characteristics	Six3os is found head to head with the Six3 gene (Blackshaw (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823).. Six3os undergoes extensive alternative splicing, that, combined with alternative 5' start sites, creates 12 known Six3os isoforms (Blackshaw (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823, Alfano (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15703187, Geng (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17084678).. Isoforms are up to ~7kb in length (Geng (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17084678).
Six3os	RNCR1	Expression	Human and mouse Six3os transcripts both show expression restricted to retina and brain (Alfano (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15703187).. Shows dynamic expression during mouse retinal development with an expression pattern generally concordant with, by sometimes more restricted than, Six3 (Blackshaw (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823, Alfano (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15703187, Geng (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17084678).. Expression was not altered in Six3 null embryos (Geng (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17084678).
Six3os	RNCR1	Conservation	Found in mouse and humans (Alfano (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15703187).
Six3os	RNCR1	Misc	The Six3 protein coding gene is an essential transcription factor involved in the development of the visual system.. One Six3os isoform has a potential ORF, however homology searching does not identify similarity to any other proteins suggesting it may not be a real ORF.
Six3os	RNCR1	Name	RNCR1: Retinal noncoding RNA 1. Six3os: Six3 opposite strand transcript
snaR	small NF90-associated RNAs	Name	snaR: small NF90-associated RNAs
snaR	small NF90-associated RNAs	Characteristics	~117nt. RNA polymerase III transcripts. Highly structured. snaR genes shares sequence identity with Alu RNA and two potential piRNAs. Cloned snaR sequences have a run of adenines in the 3' end followed by a run of thymidines (which presumably constitute the PolIII termination site) (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395).. snaR-A and snaR-B were originally identified associated to the Nuclear factor 90 (NF90) (a double-stranded RNA-binding protein implicated in multiple cellular functions) by in vivo cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation.RNA species immunoprecipitated with NF90 were ~80â120 nt long (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17913627). Several related RNAs of ~104 nt were originally cloned and identified, with snaR-A being the major component, and snaR-B representing the minor subset.  snaR-A and snaR-B are ~90% identical in sequence. Human genomic sequences corresponding to snaR-A and snaR-B have occasional mismatches (suggested to be possibly due to C-to-U editing of the RNA).. snaR genes occur in multiple copies (accumulated by segmental duplication) arranged in two inverted regions of tandem repeats on human chromosome 19. Additional snaR gene copies are present, with two of them adjacent to genes encoding the beta chain of chorionic gonadotropin:. In total, 28 snaR genes have been identified in the human genome, including 14 genes for snaR-A and 2 genes for snaR-B. snaR genes identified by sequence analysis include 5 snaR-C genes and additional genes (snaR-D, -E, -F, -G1, -G2, -H, -I, -12 and -21) (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395). snaR-D to -G include 5 unique genes on chromosome 19 as well as single copies (snaR-2 and -3) on chromosomes 2 and 3. snaR-G1 and -G2 are located in a gene-rich 2.1 Mb genomic fragment between the two clusters, lying within the promoter region of two genes encoding the beta polypeptide of chorionic gonadotropin (CG-beta) (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395).
snaR	small NF90-associated RNAs	Expression	Predominantly cytoplasmic, unstable (half-life of ~15 min in HeLa cells), expressed in diverse cell lines and human tissues. The different snaR genes have different expression levels and profiles, and, among more than 20 adult human tissues analysed, snaR transcripts are found particularly abundant in testis, with low levels detected in brain, placenta and some other organs. (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395, Parrott (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053).. Highly abundant in some cells, with snaR-A estimated in ~70,000 copies in a HEK293T cell (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395).. snaR-A and snaR-G2 are differentially expressed in discrete regions of the human brain and other tissues, such as testis (Parrott (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053). snaR-A was expression n testis was ~100-fold higher than in term placenta, lung and adipose tissue, and in brain its levels were ~10% of the testis level in three of four segments of pituitary gland, with substantial expression also observed in other brain regions (such as hypothalamus, globus pallidus and thalamus) (Parrott (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053). snaR-G2 levels in adult brain were ~55% of that in testis (highest in caudate/accumbens/putamen and globus pallidus), and several tissues displayed 5â15% of testis levels. Fetal brain contained much less snaR-G2 than adult brain (~3% of testis level), suggestive of developmental regulation. (Parrott (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053). snaR-A is up-regulated in transformed and immortalized human cells (Parrott et al. 2010).
snaR	small NF90-associated RNAs	Function	Functions of snaR transcripts have not been identified yet.. snaR transcripts interact with NF90's double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395), and snaR-A is also found stably bound to ribosomes in HeLa cells (Parrott et al. 2010).. Suggested to be involved in tissue- and species-specific regulation of cell growth and translation (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395, Parrott (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20028844, Parrott (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053).
snaR	small NF90-associated RNAs	Conservation	snaR genes are present exclusively in African Great Apes and some are unique to humans. Human snaR-A has orthologs in chimpanzee but not rhesus macaque or mouse. Chimpanzee has fewer snaR genes than humans (10 instead of 28). snaRs appear to have undergone accelerated evolution (snaR genes display a lower degree of homology within the gene than in their flanking sequence) and differential expansion in the great apes.  (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395, Parrott et al. 2010). There are ~17 nt changes between human snaR-A (121nt) and snaR-C  (119nt) species (~14% difference), compared to an average substitution rate of ~3.7?nt per 120nt (~3% difference) outside of the snaR locus (Parrott (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053).. The single snaR gene on chimpanzee chromosome 2a is 94% identical with its ortholog on human chromosome 2, and two genes on chimpanzee chromosome 19 are orthologous with snaR-G1 (a unique gene on human chromosome 19). The position of these snaR genes relative to the primate-specific CG-beta genes is conserved. (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395)
snaR	small NF90-associated RNAs	Misc	*Two families of snaR-related genetic elements were identified in primates: CAS (catarrhine ancestor of snaR), limited to Old World Monkeys and apes; and ASR  (Alu/snaR-related), present in all monkeys and apes. These two classes appear to have spread by retrotransposition.. It has been proposed that snaR genes evolved through a series of internal deletions and expansions  from the left monomer of the primate-specific Alu SINE family via ASR and CAS (Parrott (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053).. *Short RNAs of ~26â34 nt can be detected after long exposure of Northern blots with snaR probes (Parrott (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395).. *Other RNAs are also found associated with NF90, including viral RNAs, such as the VAI and VAII noncoding RNAs from human adenoviruses (Liao (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9671709).
SNHG1	UHG	Characteristics	Spliced transcript with a number of short exons (>40bp) and snoRNA containing introns (Tycowski (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559254)..  . Transcriptional start site has characteristics of 5' TOP gene family (Tycowski (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559254).. ~1.1kb transcript in human (Tycowski (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559254).. Contains 8 (maybe 9) snoRNAs in human, 8 in mouse (Tycowski (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559254).
SNHG1	UHG	Expression	Localised to the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes (Pelczar (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9671460).. RNA unstable in both human and mouse cells (Tycowski (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559254, Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755), can be stabilised by inhibition of protein synthesis. This suggests SNHG1 may be sensitive to nonsense mediated decay and could be therefore be "translated" but perhaps only to degrade it (Tycowski (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559254).. Up-regulated during lineage restriction of neural stem cells into bipotent neuronal/oligodendrocyte progenitors in vitro (Mercer (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068).
SNHG1	UHG	Conservation	Mouse SNHG1 is in a syntenic position with the human host gene. However, there is little conservation of exonic sequence compared to intronic snoRNA sequence (Tycowski (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559254, Tanaka-Fujita (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468437).
SNHG1	UHG	Name	SNHG1: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 1. UHG: U22 host gene
SNHG3	U17HG, linc1343	Characteristics	Upstream from the RCC1 protein coding gene. Multiple SNHG3 splice isoforms exist, minority join RCC1, majority do not. Isoforms range from ~0.9kb to ~2.6kb in human.. Contain U17a and U17b snoRNAs in introns. . SNHG3 contains a number of exonic Alu elements. Transcriptional start site has characteristics of 5' TOP gene family.
SNHG3	U17HG, linc1343	Expression	Localised to cytoplasm.. Unlike SNHG1 it was not stabilised by translation inhibitors or associated with translating ribosomes and was unaffected by translation inhibitors.. Identified as expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018).. Transcript found to be unstable with a half-life <2 hr in mouse N2A (neuroblastoma) cells and human B cells (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
SNHG3	U17HG, linc1343	Conservation	Not highly conserved, ~40-50% identity between mouse and human exons.
SNHG3	U17HG, linc1343	Name	SNHG3: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 3
SNHG3	U17HG, linc1343	Function	Involved in maintaining pluripotency in ESCs (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018).. Knockdown in mECSs lead to down-regulation of Nanog, Sox2, Klf4 and Oct4 expression as well as changes to ESC morphology (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018).. Snhg3 was found to interact with a number of chromatin binding proteins/complexes in mESCs including PRC1, PRC2, JARID1B and SUV39H1, with the general pattern being interaction with repressors of gene expression (Guttman (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874018).
SNHG4	U19H	Characteristics	Upstream from the Matrin 3 protein coding gene. A number of splice isoforms of SNHG4 exist, some of which join Matrin3 and so act as an upstream initiation site for Matrin 3. . SNHG4 specific isoforms appear to contain the first four SNHG4 exons and differ at the 3' end.. Contains U19 snoRNA in intron 3 (annotated as SNORA74A in Refseq).. Transcriptional start site has characteristics of the 5' TOP gene family.
SNHG4	U19H	Expression	Expressed in a number of adult human tissues.. Shows a nucleoplasmic localisation. In constrast to other SNHG RNA (SNHG1, SNHG3)  which are localised in the cytoplasm.. Human SNHG4 isoforms 1&2 were highly stable in B cells (half-life >8 hr), while mouse Snhg4 was highly unstable in mouse 3T3 cells, suggesting differential stability between species (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
SNHG4	U19H	Conservation	Likely present in mouse with same relationship with Matrin 3
SNHG4	U19H	Name	SNHG4: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 4
SNHG5	U50HG	Characteristics	Contains U50 and U50-like snoRNAs in introns (Tanaka (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10792466).. Alternatively spliced transcript (Tanaka (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10792466).. Refseq isoform is ~0.5kb in humans.. Transcriptional start site has characteristics of 5' TOP gene family (Tanaka (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10792466).
SNHG5	U50HG	Expression	Broadly expressed in human adult tissues.. Identified as enriched in the cytoplasm of human GM12878, HepG2, HUVEC and K562 cells bu nuclear enriched in HeLaS3 (Derrien (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22955988).. RNA is unstable with a half-life <2 hr in mouse N2A (neuroblastoma) and 3T3 cells and a half-life ~2 hr in human B cells  (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
SNHG5	U50HG	Conservation	Mouse has two transcripts at syntenic loci which are separated by several hundred kb and contain U50. Some sequence similarity is found between then so it is likely they share a common ancestor (Tanaka-Fujita (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468437).. Comparing mouse and human host transcripts revealed they were "dissimilar". It was hypothesized that the host transcripts share a common ancestor but there has been little selection for maintaining the sequence the host gene exons (Tanaka-Fujita (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468437). 
SNHG5	U50HG	Misc	SNHG5 forms a novel translocation breakpoint with Bcl6 in a diffuse large B-cell (DLB) lymphoma, although it is unclear if SNHG5 contributed to malignancy (Tanaka (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10792466).
SNHG5	U50HG	Name	SNHG5: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 5
SNHG6	U87HG	Characteristics	Spliced transcript with U87 snoRNA in second intron. . ~0.5kb transcript. Transcriptional start site has characteristics of 5' TOP gene family.
SNHG6	U87HG	Expression	Broad expression in human and mouse tissues.. Localises mostly to the cytoplasm . Human transcript found to show greater stability that SNHG1 in Hela cells (Makarova (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16226852). Also found to be quite stable in human B cells with a half-life of 7 hr, while mouse Snhg6 was significantly less stable (half-life 2.2hrs in 3T3 cells), suggesting the transcripts may have different stabilities between species (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755). . Minority of SNHG6 associates with monosomes. . Blocking translation led to a very modest increase in SNHG6 levels, in contrast to SNHG1 (which showed a large increase in transcript level) suggesting it is not very sensitive to nonsense mediated decay. This may help explain its increased stability. 
SNHG6	U87HG	Function	Unknown, however the authors point out that 5' TOP family genes are important for translation and that ribosomal associated SNHGs could be involved in this process as well.

SNHG6	U87HG	Name	SNHG6: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 6
Sox2ot	SOX2OT, Sox2dot	Characteristics	SOX2OT holds within one of its introns the single-exon SOX2 gene, overlapping in the same transcriptional orientation (Fantes (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12612584).. Sox2ot has multiple transcription start sites, and several splicing isoforms and polyadenylation sites (Amaral (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420).. Mouse full-length clones range in size from 638 nt (GenBank accession no. BY721402) to ~3.5 kb (accession no. AK031919), consistent with Northern blot signals in mouse tissues, which show a major band of ~3kb, but also additional discrete bands of ~1, 4, 6, and >10 kb. In zebrafish embryos, Northern blot analysis showed a major band of ~2.5 kb, as well as less intense bands of ~1.5 and ~6 kb (Amaral (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420).. Alternative transcriptional start sites for Sox2ot homologs detected in different vertebrates are associated with highly conserved elements, transposon-free regions and histone modifications typical of promoters. These include a distal promoter that creates a Sox2ot isoform named Sox2dot ("Sox2 distal overlapping transcript"), located more than 0.5Mb upstream of the Sox2 gene in mouse (Amaral (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420), and which also has demonstrated enhancer activity in mouse developing forebrain.
Sox2ot	SOX2OT, Sox2dot	Expression	Sox2ot is a stable transcript expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells, which, like Sox2, is down-regulated upon induction of embryoid body (EB) differentiation, but, unlike Sox2, is up-regulated during EB late differentiation. Sox2ot absolute levels are higher in cultured neurospheres, and Sox2 and Sox2ot are concordantly up-regulated in differentiated neurospheres. Sox2dot isoform is expressed at very low levels in undifferentiated neurospheres, but with a marked increase in the more differentiated neurospheres.. In situ hybridization analysis of mouse brain sections of Sox2ot and Sox2dot expression detected both transcripts in zones of adult neurogenesis, such as the subventricular zone, rostral migratory stream and olfactory bulb (where Sox2dot is most highly expressed) (Mercer (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18184812, Amaral (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420).. Many Sox2ot isoforms are present in whole embryo and newborn mouse. In adult mouse, different isoforms are detected primarily in brain, but also at lower levels in tissues where Sox2 is detected, such as lung, or not detected, such as testis. In adult tissues, Sox2dot was only detected in brain.. Highly enriched binding of neuronal transcriptional repressor NRSF/REST has been found in conserved sites upstream of Sox2ot.. Sox2ot is dynamically regulated during chicken and zebrafish embryogenesis, consistently associated with central nervous system structures, including fish embryo eyes, but also mesoderm tissues. During chicken development, increasing levels ofSox2ot were observed after 2days of embryonic development, similar to the pattern observed for Sox2, although with lower absolute expression levels. Expression of both Sox2 and Sox2ot was enriched to the head of 6.5-d chicken embryos, compared to the limbs and whole body. In fish, sox2 and sox2ot presented concordant up-regulation after the sphere stage, suggesting that both are early zygotic genes, but their expression patterns diverged after the tailbud stage when sox2ot total levels decreased. Sox2dot is expressed at very low levels in early embryos, but is dramatically induced at 5 dpf.. In humans, qRT-PCR analysis showed that SOX2OT is highly enriched in the brain, where SOX2 is also predominantly expressed, but also detected in other tissues such as testis. The distribution of SOX2OT ESTs in human tissues also showed a high predominance in CNS libraries, with greatest enrichment in "lens," followed by subthalamic nucleus and Alzheimer cortex, while it is found in lowest relative abundance in cerebellum (Amaral (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420).
Sox2ot	SOX2OT, Sox2dot	Function	Function of Sox2ot is undetermined. SOX2OT is a candidate gene involved in myopia, as upstream or intronic regions of Sox2ot isoforms were identified as a myopia common susceptibility locus by linkage disequilibrium analysis (Andrew (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18846214).
Sox2ot	SOX2OT, Sox2dot	Conservation	Isoforms are positionally conserved in vertebrates. At primary sequence level, although not highly conserved overall, there are regions of high conservation, such as a 384nt-stretch in the exons immediately flanking Sox2 with 91.2% identity between the mouse and human genomes (Amaral (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420).. Some exons of SOX2OT may be species- or clade-specific (Amaral (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420).. Multiple SOX2OT promoters are associated with highly conserved elements in vertebrates and orthologous transcripts are detected with transcription start sites of transcripts detected in fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals (Amaral (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420).

SPRY4-IT1	AK024556	Characteristics	Single exon ~700 nt transcript expressed in sense direction from the 2nd intron in SPRY4.. Contains a SINE at 5' end.. Secondary structure predicted to contain several long hairpins and multiple pseudoknots.  
SPRY4-IT1	AK024556	Expression	Expression significantly up-regulated in melanoma cell lines and patient tumour samples (both primary and metastatic) compared to melanocytes and keratinocytes. . SPRY4-IT1 showed much greater expression variation across 20 human tissue than SPRY4. Both showed positively correlated expression and depending on the tissue either could be more highly expressed than the other.. Knockdown of SPRY4-IT1 did not affect expression levels of SPRY4, validating that the two transcripts are independent.. Localized predominately in the cytoplasm. Larger punctate nuclear signal could be transcription sites. 
SPRY4-IT1	AK024556	Function	Knockdown of SPRY4-IT1 in melanoma cells lines decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis. SPRY4-IT1 impacts cell invasion and cell mobility with decreased invasion and motility in SPRY4-IT1 knockdown cells and increased mobility (faster speed of migration) in SPRY4-IT1 over-expressing cell lines.   
SPRY4-IT1	AK024556	Conservation	Not well conserved outside of primate, with 5' SINE element and predicted secondary structural elements only present in primates. 
SPRY4-IT1	AK024556	Misc	SPRY4 protein coding gene is also more highly expressed in melanoma cells and patient samples compared to melanocytes.. It is unclear if SPRY4-IT1 has a separate promoter or is transcribed as part of the SPRY4 transcript.
SPRY4-IT1	AK024556	Name	SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 (non-protein coding)
SRA	SRA1	Function	Forms ribonucleoprotein complexes with a number of nuclear receptors (including many steroid hormone receptors) generally acting to stimulate transcriptional activation (Lanz (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10199399, Leygue (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17710122).. Interacts either directly or through a complex with a number of other co-activator and repressor proteins, such as SRC-1, Sharp, SLIRP and p68 and p72 RNA helicases. SRA has been suggested to act as a scaffold for these complexes (reviewed in Leygue (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17710122).. Transgenic expression of SRA in vivo caused hyperplasia and morphological abnormalities in steroid hormone responsive tissues. Hyperplasia was accompanied by higher apoptosis however and expression of SRA did not lead to tumourigenesis (Lanz (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14517287).. Associated with cardiomyopathy in humans, a role in heart development was validated in zebrafish but it's unclear if SRAP or SRA or both is responsible (Friedrichs (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19064678).. SRA activity is regulated by pseudouridylation (Zhao (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15327771, Zhao (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17170069).
SRA	SRA1	Conservation	SRA ncRNA conserved in mammals (Leygue (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17710122).. SRAP Protein is conserved in chordata (Chooniedass-Kothari (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15147866).
SRA	SRA1	Name	Steroid receptor RNA Activator
SRA	SRA1	Characteristics	Bifunctional gene, active as an RNA and encodes a conserved protein SRAP (reviewed in Leygue (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17710122).. SRA has a large number of isoforms, most of which share a central core region. Only some isoforms are also able to encode the SRAP protein, and differential splicing may be one mechanism of generating coding and noncoding isoforms of SRA (Hube (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16848684) (reviewed in Leygue (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17710122).. A number of functional motifs, with predicted secondary structures, are required for SRA RNA function (Lanz (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12444263). 
SRA	SRA1	Expression	Expressed in a wide range of tissues, some isoforms appear to have tissue specific expression (Lanz (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10199399, Lanz (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14517287).. Up-regulated in tumours of steroid hormone responsive tissues ie: breast, uterus and ovary compared to matched normal tissue (Murphy (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11103781, Lanz (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14517287).. Found in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Lanz (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14517287, Zhao (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17170069).
SRA	SRA1	Misc	Some isoforms of SRA encode a conserved protein product SRAP, which is also expressed in normal tissues and breast cancer (Emberley (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12565891, Chooniedass-Kothari (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15147866, Chooniedass-Kothari (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16152589).. Studies show SRAP can also regulate the activity of nuclear receptors and bind to promoter regions regulated by nuclear receptors, suggesting functional similarities between SRA RNA and SRAP (Chooniedass-Kothari (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398657, Chooniedass-Kothari (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153324).. Leygue (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17710122 provides a useful review of the literature.
SRG1	None known	Characteristics	Three transcripts: . ~400 and 500bp transcripts, start upstream of the SER3 protein coding gene and cover SER3 promoter. Differ in 3' end with longer form also covering the beginning of the SER3 coding sequence. Polyadenylated (Martens (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15175754, Thompson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17074811).. ~1.9kb transcript, begins at same position but runs to the end of the SER3 gene (Martens (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15175754, Thompson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17074811).. Could identity TATA-binding protein and RNA polymerase II binding to drive SRG1 expression (Martens (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15175754).
SRG1	None known	Expression	SRG1 is expressed under growth conditions where SER3 is not expressed (Martens (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15175754).. SRG1 expression is regulated by serine levels (Martens (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16291644).. Despite being identified as cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) (Davis (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16484372), SRG1 transcripts were predominately degraded in the cytoplasm not the nuclear exosome. (Thompson (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17074811).
SRG1	None known	Function	SRG1 inhibits transcription of SER3 by transcriptional interference, as the process of SRG1 transcription through the SER3 promoter prevents transcription factor binding to this locus (Martens (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15175754). SRG1 transcription does not appear to be sufficient for repression with proper chromatin remodeling also required (Davis (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16484372). . SER3 is an enzyme involved in serine biosynthesis, whose expression is regulated by the level of serine. Serine level controlled the expression of SRG1, with SRG1 transcribed when serine is present and repressed when it is not. This regulation depended on Cha4, a serine dependent regulator, which binds the SRG1 promoter. When serine is high Cha4 appears to recruit the SAGA and Swi/Snf complexes to SRG1 promoter to activate SRG1 expression and repress SER3 (Martens (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16291644).
SRG1	None known	Conservation	SRG1 promoter/  TATA element is conserved in multiple yeast species (Martens (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15175754).
SRG1	None known	Name	SRG1: SER3 regulatory gene 1

Isoforms are between 900-1300 bp, with 4-6 exons and polyadenlyated.. ST7OT3 - Spliced ~1kb transcript. Begins in intron 10 of ST7, shares exons 11-13 and sometimes 14 & 15 with ST7 plus has a number of unique exons. Some exons may also act as a alternative 3' end for ST7.. ST7OT4 - Multiple spliced transcripts within the long first intron of ST7. However, Refseq ST7OT4 transcript may be protein coding. Transcription begins just ~200bp downstream from the end of first ST7 exon.

SUC2uxut1-3	SUC2uxut1
SUC2uxut2
SUC2uxut3	Characteristics	Three Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript (XUTs) upstream from SUC2 gene.. SUC2uxut1 (~2.3kb) in sense direction  . SUC2uxut2 (~1.2kb) and SUC2uxut3 (~1kb) in antisense direction overlapping SUC2uxut1.
SUC2uxut1-3	SUC2uxut1
SUC2uxut2
SUC2uxut3	Expression	Up-regulated in Xrn1 (5'-3' cytoplasmic exonuclease) knockout but unchanged in TRAMP nuclear degradation pathway knockout. Hence degraded by Xrn1 cytoplasmic pathway.. SUC2uxut1 reversibly upregulated by lithium. 
SUT719		Characteristics	Antisense to SUR7 coding gene. SUT719 comes from a bidirectional promoter with GAL80 where they share regulatory signals. The 3' end of SUT719 extends through and beyond the SUR7 transcription start site.  
SUT719		Expression	SUT719 and SUR7 are both expressed in standard galactose media. Upon stimulation with alpha-factor pheromone SUR7 is switched off while SUT719 continues to be expressed.. SUT719 expression is regulated by Gal4 (as is the expression of GAL80, which shares a bidirectional promoter with SUT719).
SUT719		Function	SUT719 is required for complete switching off of SUR7 expression (disruption of SUT719 expression allows SUR7 expression after stimulation with alpha-factor pheromone when it would normally not be expressed).. SUT719 acts to fine tune gene expression by impacting the on/off threshold of SUR7. When SUR7 is expressed at low levels it is inhibited by SUT719, but high level SUR7 gene expression is not affected by SUT719.
SUT719		Misc	Regulation of GAL80 gene expression also affects SUT719, as they both come from a bidirectional promoter. In turn, SUT719 can regulate the expression of SUR7. This demonstrates a model whereby neighbouring coding genes regulate each other via ncRNA expression/ regulation and also a mechanism for spreading a regulatory signal (ie: that imposed on GAL80) along a chromosome.
SUT719		Name	SUT719: Stable Uncharacterized Transcript 719
TEA ncRNAs	None known	Characteristics	TEA transcripts originate from the TEA promoter at the 5' of the array of joining (J) gene segments of the T-cell receptor alpha chain (TCRA) (de Villartay (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3500476). Another noncoding transcript has been identified coming from a promoter within the J array (J-alpha 49).. TEA transcription extends up to ~71kb, covering the length of the J array and terminating in the C alpha region (de Villartay (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3500476). . Full length of actual spliced TEA transcript reported as ~2kb (de Villartay (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3500476, Shimizu (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8383995). ~4.5 and 8kb transcripts have also been reported. Transcripts generally include TEA sequence spliced to C alpha and sometimes include J segments (Villey (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9247569). 
TEA ncRNAs	None known	Expression	Expressed during thymocyte development at a time recombination is occurring (Abarrategui (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16936730, Abarrategui (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17882258). Expression is highest in fetal thymocytes and is absent in mature adult T cells (de Villartay (1987) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3500476, Shimizu (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8383995).. TEA transcripts have been identified in the nucleus (Abarrategui (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17882258).
TEA ncRNAs	None known	Function	TEA transcription regulates V alpha-to-J alpha recombination and is necessary to generate the full complement of recombined segments (Abarrategui (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16936730, Abarrategui (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17882258).. Transcription has both activating and repressive effects on the promoters of different J segments. Segments only a small distance downstream from the TEA promoter are activated while segments more distal are repressed, with alterations in histone modifications and chromatin accessibility (Abarrategui (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16936730, Abarrategui (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17882258).. These effects target initial recombination events to the active proximal J segments. In the absence of TEA ncRNA transcription recombination occurs in more distal J segments which are normally repressed (Abarrategui (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16936730, Abarrategui (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17882258).. Repressive effects of the TEA ncRNA suggested to be due to transcriptional interference. Unknown if TEA ncRNA also has a function itself, ie: recruitment of chromatin modification complexes (Abarrategui (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16936730, Abarrategui (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17882258).

TERRA	TelRNAs	Characteristics	Heterogeneous sizes (between 100 nt and 9 kb); transcribed from telomeric C-rich strand (RNAs contain UUAGGG repeats) from telomeres, initiating in subtelomeric regions.. Transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Polyadenylated. (Azzalin (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17916692, Schoeftner (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18157120)
TERRA	TelRNAs	Expression	TERRA expression is regulated by several mechanisms, especially telomere length. Measured RNA stability indicates a half-life of approximately 2.2 h (Schoeftner (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18157120).. Nuclear-restricted. Detected in different human and rodent cell lines. Levels vary according to developmental stage, cellular stress, tumour differentiation and chromatin structure: very low levels in mouse embryos between days 11.5 and 15.5 of embryonic gestation; higher levels in all adult tissues tested, with highest levels in thymus, kidney and spleen and other tissues with low or no telomerase activity; low levels in cancer cells. (Azzalin (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17916692, Schoeftner (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18157120)
TERRA	TelRNAs	Function	TERRA RNAs remain associated to telomeric chromatin, making them potential components of mammalian telomeres, and proposed involvement in shortening of telomeres.. Telomere length correlates with TERRA levels in immortal cell lines.. TERRA siRNA knock-down caused an increase in telomere dysfunction-induced foci, aberrations in metaphase telomeres, and a loss of histone H3 trimethyl K9 and origin recognition complex (ORC) binding at telomere repeat DNA.. SMG proteins (effectors of nonsense-mediated decay) are enriched at telomeres in vivo and negatively regulate TERRA association with chromatin, protecting chromosome ends from telomere loss (Azzalin (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17916692).. TERRA transcripts inhibit telomerase activity in vitro, therefore suggested to negatively regulate telomere length. Consistent with this hypothesis, TERRA knock-down causes a loss of telomeric DNA repeats.. TERRA transcripts have recently been detected associated with heterochromatin marks typical of telemores (histone H3 trimethyl K9) as well as with different telomere proteins, including telomere repeat factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2), subunits of the ORC, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), and members of the DNA-damage-sensing pathway. In particular, TERRA can interact directly with the TRF2 amino-terminal GAR domain and ORC1 to form a stable ternary complex, and ORC1 binding to TRF2 is RNase A sensitive (Deng (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19716786).. Different lines of evidence indicate that TERRA transcripts form a parallel G-quadruplex structure localized to telomere DNA at cell nuclei, and may form an intermolecular G-quadruplex with DNA (Xu (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18776307, Xu (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20679250).
TERRA	TelRNAs	Conservation	TERRA RNAs have been described in different vertebrates (Schoeftner (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18157120) and yeast (Luke (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19026778), and more recently in Arabidopsis (Vrbsky (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20548962).
TERRA	TelRNAs	Misc	Telomeric repeat-containing transcripts have been described in Arabidopsis. A portion of these TERRA transcripts are processed into small interfering RNAs, which contribute to the maintenance of telomeric chromatin through promoting methylation of asymmetric cytosines in telomeric (CCCTAAA)(n) repeats. This process relies on the RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway  (Vrbsky (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20548962).
TERRA	TelRNAs	Names	TERRA: telomeric repeat-containing RNAs. TelRNAs: Telomeric RNAs 
tie-1as	None known	Characteristics	804 nucleotide, unspliced transcript, antisense to the 3' of tie1 in Zebrafish.. Tie-1as initiates just 3' of the tie-1 3'UTR, runs antisense through 3'UTR and into last exon.
tie-1as	None known	Expression	Tie1-as and tie-1 show similar developmental expression patterns with both being up-regulated after gastrulation but tie-1 expression is ~10x higher.. At 24 hours post fertilisation (hpf), tie-1 and tie-1as are both expressed in some tissues but tie1-as is also expressed in brain and otic vesicles where tie1 is not expressed.. Genomic DNA downstream from tie1 3'UTR was shown to have promoter activity supporting the presence of an antisense transcript.
tie-1as	None known	Function	Overlapping region of tie1 and tie-1as appear to duplex in-vivo, which appears to reduce levels of the tie-1 transcript.. Overexpression of Zebrafish tie-1as in-vivo caused vascular defects during zebrafish development, while over-expression of human tie-1as caused defects in endothelial cell junctions in human cells.
tie-1as	None known	Conservation	Identified in zebrafish, similar transcripts may also be present in human and mouse.
tie-1as	None known	Misc	Sequence and precise genome location of the transcripts have not been defined.
Tip1	Transcribed intergenic polycomb 1	Characteristics	Downstream of Utf1 coding gene.. No evidence of transcriptional connection between Utf1 and Tip1.

Tip1	Transcribed intergenic polycomb 1	Function	Insertion of Tip1 upstream of a luciferase reporter gene could silence the luciferase reporter in mESCs. Effect was strand independent, (orientation of Tip1 DNA sequence did not matter). However, Tip1 RNA was not necessary for this function.. Knockdown of endogenous Tip1 did not effect expression of the cis (Utf1) gene in mESCs. Knockdown was associated with the up-regulation of other genes, including Syn1, which is normally upregulated during ESC differentiation. Suggesting Tip1 has a trans-repressive function in mESCs.
Tip1	Transcribed intergenic polycomb 1	Misc	Exact transcription initiation and termination site of Tip3 not defined, so transcript could be larger than genomic region provided.
Tip3	Transcribed intergenic polycomb 3, AK050890, ENSMUSG00000092589	Characteristics	Downstream of Nkx2-9 coding gene. Appears to be independent transcript.
Tip3	Transcribed intergenic polycomb 3, AK050890, ENSMUSG00000092589	Expression	Expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) despite presence of H3K27me3 histone marks over Tip3 loci. . Tip3 expression increased upon mESCs differentiation to neural progenitors and then was switched off as the progenitor cells differentiated in neurons. Expression changes occurred alongside continued H3K27me3 marks at locus.
Tip3	Transcribed intergenic polycomb 3, AK050890, ENSMUSG00000092589	Function	Insertion of Tip3 upstream of a luciferase reporter gene could silence the luciferase reporter in mESCs. Effect was strand independent, (orientation of Tip3 DNA sequence did not matter). Tip3 RNA was required for silencing.. Knockdown of endogenous Tip3 did not effect expression of the cis (Nkx2-9) gene in mESCs. Knockdown was associated with the up-regulation of other genes, including Lzic and Stox2, which are normally upregulated during ESC differentiation. Suggesting Tip1 has a trans-repressive function in mESCs.
Tip3	Transcribed intergenic polycomb 3, AK050890, ENSMUSG00000092589	Conservation	Contains block of sequence conserved in most vertebrates.
Tip3	Transcribed intergenic polycomb 3, AK050890, ENSMUSG00000092589	Misc	Exact start and stop site of tip3 not defined but likely to be represented by Ak050890
TIR1axut	TIR1 antisense Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript 	Characteristics	Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript (XUT) antisense to TIR1 gene.. 5' of transcript begins in intergenic region downstream of TIR1 with 3' end overlapping TIR1 in antisense direction.
TIR1axut	TIR1 antisense Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript 	Expression	Up-regulated by Xrn1 knockout. Hence degraded by cytoplasmic Xrn1 degradation pathway.
TIR1axut	TIR1 antisense Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript 	Function	TIR1 is down-regulated upon Xrn1 inactivation. Interrupting TIR1axut expression restored most of TIR1 expression suggesting TIR1axut silences TIR1. Therefore antisense XUTs can repress the transcripts they overlap. . Full TIR1axut repression requires Set1 activity and appears to be antagonised by H3K4me3.. Nb: Currently unclear exactly how silencing is mediated by TIR1axut.
Tmevpg1	None known	Characteristics	Found within the Tmevpg3 genetic locus which controls Theiler's virus persistance/ load (Vigneau (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11735227).. Promoter contains binding sites for E2A and the Ets family of transcription factors. Suggesting regulation by transcription factors involved in the immune system (Vigneau (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11735227).. Spliced with 5 or 6 exons depending on isoform/ species (Vigneau (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11735227).
Tmevpg1	None known	Expression	In resistant mice Tmevpg1 is constitutively expressed in CD4+ and CD8+immune cells in the spleen and thymus and upon infection, by immune cells infiltrating into the CNS, however no Tmevpg1 expression was seen in susceptible mice (Vigneau (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11735227, Vigneau (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12719555).. Found in peripheral blood lymphocytes in humans with expression in NK+ cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Vigneau (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11735227, Vigneau (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12719555).. In both mouse and humans Tmevpg1 was down-regulated upon immune cell activation with a reciprocal up-regulation in interferon gamma (Ifng) expression (Vigneau (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12719555). 
Tmevpg1	None known	Function	It has been speculated there may be a regulatory regulationship between Tmevpg1 and Ifng to explain their reciprocal expression (Vigneau (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12719555).
Tmevpg1	None known	Conservation	Present in mouse and human. Sequence conservation is limited to the promoter, first exons and its splice site, otherwise the transcripts are poorly conserved and can contain repeat elements (Vigneau (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11735227).
Tmevpg1	None known	Misc	The Tmevpg3 genetic locus was found to control persistence of Theiler's virus in the central nervous system, along with the H-2D gene, this QTL locus was found to be near but exclude the interferon gamma (Ifng) gene (Bihl (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10224268).
Tmevpg1	None known	Name	Tmevpg1: Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus persistence candidate gene 1
TncRNA	TSU	Characteristics	~480 nuc (Peyman (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9858482), independent transcript from the 3' end of the Neat1 short isoform/MEN epsilon.. Contains a number of sequence motifs that match binding sites for proteins involved in cytokine signalling which up-regulate MHC genes (Peyman (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9858482). 
TncRNA	TSU	Expression	Expressed exclusively in the placenta and pancreas while full length Neat1 is expressed ubiquitously. Placenta was the only tissue where TncRNA predominated (Peyman (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9858482). 
TncRNA	TSU	Function	Suppressed induction of MHC class II antigens by interferon gamma and partially blocked constitutive and interferon gamma induced expression of MHC class I antigens and ICAM-I (Peyman (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9858482, Geirsson (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12565840). . Suppressed major histocompatibility (MHC) class II expression in-vitro through inhibition of class II transactivator (CIITA) promoters (Geirsson (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12565840, Geirsson (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12883198, Geirsson (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15454174). Also bound STAT1 and reduced its nuclear translocation (Peyman (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9858482), contributing to suppression of MHCII and I in human trophoblast cells and hence preventing a deleterious maternal immune response to placental invasion of the uterine wall.. Note: While STAT1 binds the CIITA promoter, it's binding did not appear to be affected by TncRNA, which acted on an area with no known transcription factor binding sites (Geirsson (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12883198), so the mechanism is unclear.
TncRNA	TSU	Misc	This transcript comes from the very 3' end of the Neat1 short isoform. It is therefore part of Neat1 but as described above appears to be expressed independently with a function different to that of the full length transcript.
TncRNA	TSU	Name	TncRNA: trophoblast noncoding RNA.. TSU: trophoblast STAT utron (untranslated region of an mRNA).
TPO1axut	TPO1 antisense Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript 	Characteristics	Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript (XUT) antisense to TPO1 gene. Transcript initiates within TPO1 gene.
TPO1axut	TPO1 antisense Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript 	Expression	Upregulated by Xrn1 knockout. Hence degraded by Xrn1 cytoplasmic pathway.. TPO1axut is reversibly up-regulated by lithium
TPO1axut	TPO1 antisense Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcript 	Function	TPO1 is down-regulated upon Xrn1 inactivation, hence it is possible TPO1axut represses TPO1, similar to the action of other XUTs.
Tsix	None known	Characteristics	~40 kb; antisense to Xist noncoding RNA gene. (*Annotation in progress)
Tsix	None known	Expression	N/A
Tsix	None known	Function	Epigenetically silences Xist expression by inhibiting RepA recruitment of polycomb complexes to maintain the active X chromosome in females (Zhao (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974356).

TUG1	None known	Characteristics	Multiple Tug1 isoforms, with a main 6.7kb transcript in mouse. Spliced (Young (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797018).
TUG1	None known	Expression	Expressed in the developing retina and brain (Young (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797018).. Expressed in adult tissues with highest expression in cortex (Young (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797018). . Expression levels are elevated in the caudate nucleus of patients suffering from the trinucleotide repeat neurodegenerative condition, Huntington's disease (Johnson (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22202438).. Localises to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Khalil (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571010). . Transcript was classified as unstable with a half-life >4 hr in human Hela cells (Tani (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369889). Similar results were found in human B cells and mouse 3T3 cells (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).
TUG1	None known	Function	Required for the proper formation of photoreceptors in the developing rodent retina (Young (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797018).. Downregulation in developing retina leads to decreased retinal transcription factor expression and increased apoptosis (Young (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797018).. TUG1 expression appears to be activated by p53 upon DNA damage, (Guttman (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780) with many p53 binding sites in the Tug1 promoter (Khalil (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571010). Tug1 associates with PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2) and represses a number of cell cycle genes (Khalil (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571010).
TUG1	None known	Conservation	Mammals - identified in mouse, rat, cow, dog and human (Young (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797018).. Present in two locations in rat, with one an apparent processed pseudogene.
TUG1	None known	Misc	Nb: Mouse NRED accession is specific to one of two Tug1 isoforms.
TUG1	None known	Name	TUG1: taurine up-regulated gene 1 (Young (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797018).
UCA1	CUDR	Characteristics	Spliced and polyadenylated with 3 exons (Wang (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18501714). . Multiple isoforms (1.4kb, 2.2kb and 2.7kb). The 2.2kb isoform contains an extended final exon compared to the 1.4kb isoform while the 2.7kb isoform has not been characterised (Wang (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16914571, Tsang (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416635, Wang (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18501714).. Sequence is mainly repeat elements. Initiates in an LTR, exons sample pieces of a HERV-H element and longer 2.2kb isoform contains a second LTR at the 3' end (Wang (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16914571).
UCA1	CUDR	Expression	Widely expressed in embryonic development (Wang (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18501714) and placenta (Wang (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16914571).. Low or no expression in normal adult tissue but highly upregulated in cell lines resistant to drug induced apoptotic cell death and bladder, colon and lung cancer (Wang (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16914571, Tsang (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416635).. Identified as a biomarker for bladder cancer (Wang (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16914571).
UCA1	CUDR	Function	Functions of 1.4kb and 2.2kb isoforms have been investigated, both appear to promote and enhance tumourigenesis (Tsang (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416635, Wang (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18501714).. Over-expression of 1.4kb isoform enhanced tumorigenic behavior of bladder cancer cells in-vitro and in-vivo. Increased drug resistance and cell motility (Wang (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18501714).. Overexpression of 2.2kb isoform caused resistance to drug induced apoptosis, potentially by downregulation of caspase 3 levels (Tsang (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416635).. 2.2kb isoform promoted transformation in-vitro, possibly because resistance to apoptosis is an important step in tumourigenesis (Tsang (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416635).
UCA1	CUDR	Conservation	Found in humans. May be present in other primates but not in more distantly related mammals (Wang (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18501714).
UCA1	CUDR	Name	Cancer up-regulated drug resistant (CUDR). Urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1)
UM9-5	NCRNA00099, KCNIP4-IT1	Characteristics	Found in an intron of KCNIP4 in the sense direction.. ~2.3kb clones were identified in pig and human. NCRNA00099 which contains UM9-5 is ~10kb. Given it's position in an intron the full length of the transcript is somewhat unclear, cloning gave shorter transcripts, while transcription could be detected over whole NCRNA00099 site (but not outside it) in human.. Transcript contains a number of repeats. 
UM9-5	NCRNA00099, KCNIP4-IT1	Expression	Identified as a RNA that is more highly expressed in adult brain than fetal brain.. Expression in human and pig was similar. Mostly restricted to adult brain, highest expression in cerebellum.. Low expression was also detected in porcine embryonic tissues
UM9-5	NCRNA00099, KCNIP4-IT1	Conservation	Transcripts identified in pig and human. Southern blotting also could identify a homologous sequence in cow but not in rodents.

VAI and VAII RNAs	VA RNA I and VA RNA II.	Name	VA I and II: virus-associated RNA I and II.
VAI and VAII RNAs	VA RNA I and VA RNA II.	Characteristics	Human adenovirus encoded.. Transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Genes are separated in the adenovirus genome by a spacer of about 98 nt.. Highly structured RNAs of 160nt (VAI) and 163nt (VAII), with heterogeneous 3' ends and containing tightly structured stems.
VAI and VAII RNAs	VA RNA I and VA RNA II.	Expression	Cytoplasmic localisation.. Expressed at very high levels during viral replication. VAII is expressed at 20-fold lower levels compared to that of VAI.
VAI and VAII RNAs	VA RNA I and VA RNA II.	Function	Important role for viral replication in infected cells (upon VAI deletion, adenovirus replication is impaired in most cells). . Thought to block PKR activity, avoiding phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and inhibition of viral mRNA translation (Thimmappaya (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6297772). PKR-binding secondary structure domain can adopt different conformations, which are functionally non-equivalent and exist in a mixed population (Wahid (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635730). . Recently, it has been shown that VA1 has an important role in suppressing the RNAi response in infected cells during viral replication (Andersson (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16014917, McKenna (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16580685, Sano (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16472808, Xu (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17652395). Processed by Dicer into small RNAs that are incorporated into RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex). Approximately 80% of Ago2-containing RISC immunopurified from late-infected cells are associated with VA RNA-derived small RNAs (mivaRNAs), processed from the 3' strand of the terminal stems of the VA RNAs (Xu (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17652395). Nevertheless, VAII seems to be the preferred substrate for Dicer, accounting for approximately 60% of all small RNAs loaded in RISC (Xu (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17652395).. A deletion study shows that VAI may perform the role of bi-functional RNA by being processed by Dicer at the terminal stem to saturate the RNAi system, while generating a shortened VAI RNA that remains active to inhibit PKR. An RNA mutant that lacked the entire terminal stem was still able to bind PKR and inhibit its activity (Wahid (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18430723).. A fraction of the VAII-derived mivaRNAs are associated with polyribosomes, indicating a possible role in regulating translation of cellular mRNAs (Xu (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17652395).
VAI and VAII RNAs	VA RNA I and VA RNA II.	Conservation	N/A
VAI and VAII RNAs	VA RNA I and VA RNA II.	Misc	[[Similar mechanism of action of EBER1 and 2 encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (McKenna (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16580685), and other viral or endogenous lncRNAs.]]
VegT RNA	None known	Characteristics	VegT is a bifunctional gene with functional RNA and protein products (Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384).. VegT protein is a T box transcription factor (Zhang (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9012531).
VegT RNA	None known	Expression	VegT RNA localises to the vegetal pole cytoskeleton in Xenopus oocytes (Zhang (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9012531, Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384).
VegT RNA	None known	Function	VegT RNA is necessary for the structure and integrity of the vegetal pole cytoskeleton (Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384) as well as the proper anchoring and localization of germ plasm islands and yolk platelets to the vegetal pole (Kloc (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17376434).  . Degradation of VegT led to the disintegration of the cytokeratin cytoskeleton (Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384).. Suggested to be integrated into the cytoskeleton holding subunits together or promoting subunit assembly (Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384).
VL30 RNAs	None known	Characteristics	Derived from VL30 mouse virus-like retrotransposons (Keshet (1980) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6248245).. Transcripts of various sizes are detected by Northern blot, including a major band of ~5kb, but also bands of ~9 and ~11kb, depending on the tissue analysed (Harrigan (1989) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2552295, Keshet (1980) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6248245). 
VL30 RNAs	None known	Expression	VL30 RNAs are found ubiquitously in adult mice tissues (Harrigan (1989) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2552295). VL30-1 RNA (a member of the VL30 family) is expressed 5- to 8-fold higher in mouse tumor lines than in mouse fibroblast or myoblast lines (Wang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19805375), and is induced by pituitary hormones in steroidogenic cells (Song (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704271).. Identified in the developing mouse periventricular germinal zones. It is also expressed extensively in the developing mouse CNS. Enriched in undifferentiated neurospheres derived from cortex in bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) and TGFa (transforming growth factor alpha), as well as from striatum in bFGF, compared to differentiated cortical neurospheres derived in bFGF. Also found expressed in both Embryonic Stem (ES) cells and Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) (Easterday (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14651920).
VL30 RNAs	None known	Function	VL30-1 binds and regulates the PSF (PTB-associated splicing factor) protein, which contains 2 RNA-binding domains (RBDs), forming a PSF-RNA complex (Wang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19805375).. VL30 RNA regulates steroidogenesis, and possibly other physiological processes, by forming a complex with PSF in mice (Song (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704271).. Ectopic expression of VL30-1 RNA in a human tumor cell promoted metastasis (Song (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11959915), and in mice over-expression of VL30-1 RNA promoted cell proliferation in culture and tumorigenesis in-vivo (Wang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19805375).. VL30-1 RNA is tumor-promoting whereas PSF is a tumor-suppressor agent, and the molar ratio of PSF protein and VL30-1 RNA regulates proto-oncogene transcription, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. VL30-1 RNA binds and releases PSF from a proto-oncogene and activates transcription of target genes (Song (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079199). For example, in mice VL30-1 RNA has been shown to bind and release PSF from the proto-oncogene Rab23, activating its transcription in-trans (Wang (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19805375). (Although VL30 RNAs are not present in the human genome, a similar regulatory mechanism functions in human cells, in which different RNA fragments bind PSF (Li (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619).). VL30 is enriched in multiple stem cell populations and may have roles in determining  "stemness", or stem cell function (Easterday (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14651920).
VL30 RNAs	None known	Misc	VL30 mouse virus-like retro-elements comprise a family of sequences, 5 to 6 kb in length and containing long terminal repeats, with 100 to 200 copies dispersed throughout the genome (Keshet (1982) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6287016).
WT1-AS	WIT1	Characteristics	0.4 - 3kb, spliced and present in multiple splicing isoforms (Dallosso (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940140), as well as a protein coding isoform (WIT1) transcribed from a downstream promoter (Eccles (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8208551,Campbell (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8290269). Transcribed antisense to WT1 from intron 1 or from the same promoter region (bidirectional) of WT1, corresponding to a differentially methylated regulatory region (Eccles (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8208551,Malik (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7478583,Malik (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10811108).
WT1-AS	WIT1	Expression	Imprinted in humans (but not in mouse), with monoallelic (paternal) expression in normal kidney (Malik (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10811108,Dallosso (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14681303,Dallosso (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940140).. Co-regulation with WT1 during mouse kidney development, and co-expression in mouse and human tissues, including fetal spleen, fetal kidney, and normal kidney  (Dallosso (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940140).. Abnormal splicing of WT1-AS has been reported in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples (Dallosso (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940140).
WT1-AS	WIT1	Function	WT1-AS transcripts are exported to the cytoplasm and form heteroduplexes with WT1 mRNA, with a  proposed regulatory role in WT1 expression via RNA:RNA interactions (Dallosso (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940140).
WT1-AS	WIT1	Conservation	WT1 has a positionally conserved antisense/bidirectional transcripts in mouse and humans, although WT1-AS  RNAs do not show extensive sequence conservation between these species, except at their 5' ends, which may extend into WT1 exon 1 (Dallosso (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940140).
WT1-AS	WIT1	Name	WT1-AS: WT1 (Wilms' tumor 1) antisense transcript
Xist	None known	Characteristics	Spliced, polyadenylated, ~17kb in mice, ~19kb in humans.. Contains repeated sequence motifs A-F that are critical for its function.. Xist is located on the X chromosome in the X-inactivation center (Xic), an approximately 100-kb region in the mouse containing (as of June 2012) five other lncRNAs, many of which play crucial roles in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). . Xist expression initiates the process of XCI in mammals.
Xist	None known	Expression	Xist is expressed in all somatic cells in female eutherian mammals, monoallelically from the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) (Brown (1991) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1985261). Xist is not expressed in males. Xist is a nuclear RNA that coats the Xi (Brown (1992) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1423611, Clemson (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636206). . In the mouse, Xist expression is imprinted at specific times and places in development: Xist is transcribed exclusively from the paternally-inherited X (and thus the paternal X is always the Xi) only in the early pre-implantation blastocyst, and later in development only in extra-embryonic tissues such as the placenta.. Imprinted XCI in humans has not been demonstrated and may not exist (Moreira de Mello (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20532033).. In somatic tissues in mouse and human, XCI is random, not imprinted: either the paternal or maternal X can express Xist and become the Xi. This decision is made in each cell of the epiblast in the mouse, and the same X is inactivated in subsequent generations of daughter cells. Thus expression of Xist (and of nearly all X-linked genes) is mosaic, in the sense that each of the two alleles is active in different populations of cells.. Stage specific expression in different regions of developing mouse retina, with Tsix displaying a similar but weaker profile (Blackshaw (2004) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823).. In female undifferentiated mouse ES (embryonic stem) and iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, Xist is not expressed and both X chromosomes are active. Differentiation of mouse ES cells results in the onset of Xist expression and XCI, and thus these cells are an important model system for the study of XCI.. In contrast, Xist expression and XCI are variable in female undifferentiated human ES cells (Shen (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339804, Silva (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339803, Hall (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18340642, Lengner (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20471072) and iPS cells (Bruck (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21276761, Hanna (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19898493, Marchetto (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21074045, Tchieu (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727844), which may reflect variability in the broader epigenetic states and developmental potential of these cells.
Xist	None known	Function	Xist is the master regulator of mammalian XCI, the mechanism of dosage compensation that balances X-linked gene expression between males and females.. Xist function is required to initiate XCI (Penny (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8538762, Marahrens (1997) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9009199). Ectopic Xist expression from an autosomal transgene causes long-range gene repression in cis (Wutz (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10882105).. Xist and RepA (see associated components below) RNAs bind to and recruit PRC2, which catalyzes the deposition of the repressive chromatin mark H3K27me3 on the Xi (Zhao (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974356, Kaneko (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21123648, Kanhere (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542000, Zhao (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659).. Small RNAs formed from Xist/Tsix duplexes may play a role in regulating Xist expression and XCI (Ogawa (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18535243). However, loss of Dicer has only a modest effect on Xist expression (Kanellopoulou (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19164542), contrary to what would be expected if RNAi is a major regulator of XCI.. hnRNP U (also known as SP120 or SAF-A) binds Xist through its RGG domain while the SAF domain is also required for localisation to the Xi. hnRNP U is required for both Xist localisation to the Xi and the initation of X-inactivation (Hasegawa (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20833368.. Xist Repeat C sequences are required for Xist localization to the Xi (Beletskii (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481485, Sarma (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21135235).. YY1 can interact with several DNA binding sites within exon 1 of Xist, and also to the repeat C (and perhaps repeat B) RNA sequences of the Xist transcript. Thus YY1 tethers Xist RNAs to the Xi and nucleates the Xist cloud that coats the Xi (Jeon (2011) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21729784).. Xist forms a transcriptionally silenced sub-nuclear domain (Chaumeil (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16912274) and perinucleolar localisation of the silent Xist coated chromosome has been observed (Zhang (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17512404). The A region repeats are essential for the recruitment of late inactivated X genes to the silencing compartment and for the recruitment of the silencing complex PRC2 (Maenner (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20052282).. After the initiation of XCI, Xist function is not absolutely required to maintain XCI in fibroblasts (Csankovszki (1999) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10431231). Nor is continued Xist expression required to maintain XCI-like repression around an autosomal Xist transgene in male, differentiated ES cells (Wutz (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10882105). However, lack of Xist function in differentiated cells can lead to partial reactivation of select X-linked genes (Csankovszki (2001) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11352938).
Xist	None known	Conservation	Xist is present in all eutherian (placental) mammals examined to date, but it is not present in marsupials or monotremes (Duret (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16778056, Davidow (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17333538, Hore (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17333539, Shevchenko (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17333537). An unrelated ncRNA in marsupials, Rsx, is likely to play a role similar to that of Xist in XCI (Grant (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722828).. The most conserved Xist RNA region, the A region, contains eight or nine repeats separated by U-rich spacers.

Xlsirts	None known	Characteristics	Family of lncRNAs. Contain varying numbers of ~80bp tandem repeats flanked by unique sequence (Spohr (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6173488). . Xlsirts localisation mediated by a 137bp repeat thought to fold into multiple stem loops (Allen (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12919101). 
Xlsirts	None known	Expression	Localises to the vegetal pole cytoskeleton in Xenopus oocytes. (Kloc (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7505061, Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384).
Xlsirts	None known	Function	Necessary for the structure and integrity of the vegetal pole cytoskeleton (Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384) as well as the proper anchoring and localization of germ plasm islands and yolk platelets to the vegetal pole (Kloc (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17376434). . Degradation of Xlsirts caused the 3D structure of the cytokeratin cytoskeleton to collapse (Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384). . Suggested to be integrated into the cytoskeleton holding subunits together or promoting subunit assembly (Kloc (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000384).
Xlsirts	None known	Name	Xenopus laevis short interspersed repeat transcripts
Y RNAs	YRNA, RNY RNAs, hY RNA (human)	Characteristics	83-112 nt. Four human Y RNAs (hY1, 112nt; hY3, 101nt; hY4, 93nt; and hY5, 83nt) encoded in single copy genes, which are present in a cluster in human chromosome 7 (Maraia (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7520568). Pyrimidine-rich, transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and contain a 5-triphosphate and a retained 3' poly(U) tail (Hendrick (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6180298).. Y RNAs form characteristic stem-loop structures, with a highly conserved double-stranded stem formed by partially complementary 5' and 3' terminal domains, linked by a loop domain containing secondary stem-loops (Teunissen (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10606662, O'Brien (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7688474, van Gelder (1994) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8041611). Parts of the RNA structure appear to be flexible, able to adopt different conformations. Y RNAs contain an essential characteristic bulged C in the middle portion of the stem  (in position 8 or 9), as well as the characteristic pyrimidine-rich region that is single-stranded in the secondary structures (Teunissen (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10606662, Green (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9671049).
Y RNAs	YRNA, RNY RNAs, hY RNA (human)	Expression	All four Y RNAs are primarily cytoplasmic, they are also detected in perinucleolar compartments, discrete structures near the nucleolar rim (Matera (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7539809).. Y RNAs are expressed in similar levels in all human tissues and cell lines investigated, with all Y RNAs showing a positively correlated expression across different tissue types (Christov (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18283318)(Pruijn (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7505620). Y RNAs are up-regulated in a number of human solid tumours compared to corresponding nonmalignant tissues. In particular, hY1 and hY3 RNAs are over-expressed in carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the bladder, cervix, colon, kidney, lung and prostate (Christov (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18283318).
Y RNAs	YRNA, RNY RNAs, hY RNA (human)	Function	The different Y RNAs may have multiple roles.. Y RNAs were identified as the RNA component of the 'small cytoplasmic' (sc) Ro autoantigen (soluble  ribonucleoproteins (RNP) detected in sera of systemic lupus erythematosis patients), binding the autoantigen La and Ro proteins (Lerner (1981) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6164096).. Y RNAs have been shown to be required for semiconservative chromosomal DNA replication in vitro, in a mammalian cell-free experimental system. hY1, hY3, hY4 and hY5 RNAs are functionally redundant (Christov (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16943439), and have been shown to act at the initiation step of DNA replication* (Krude (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19657016). (*See Krude (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20012579 for review).. Regulate cell DNA replication and cell proliferation, with knock-down of hY1 and hY3 RNA in human cells causing a cytostatic arrest of cell proliferation (Christov (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18283318, Krude (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19657016, Christov (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16943439).. Bind to Ro proteins through their terminal stem, which contains conserved binding sites for Ro60 and La proteins (Green (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9671049). The central portion of the double-stranded stem is essential for reconstituting chromosomal DNA replication, while the central loop and the terminal stem are not (Gardiner (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19474146).. Different proteins may also bind Y RNAs or be present in human Ro RNPs, such as hnRNP K, PTB, RoBP1 and nucleolin (Bouffard (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10668799, Fabini (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10785401, Fouraux (2002) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12096904), indicating that Y RNAs may be involved in their regulation, such as in the control of alternative splicing. hY5 RNA uniquely binds to ribosomal protein L5 and its binding partner 5S RNA, with Ro-Y5 suggested to have a specialized role in 5S ribosomal RNA quality control (Hogg (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18056422). Ro60 protein had been previously shown to bind misfolded small RNAs and suggested to be involved in quality control of the RNAs (Shi (1996) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8752087, Stein (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15907467, Fuchs (2006) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17041599). A role is also proposed in the regulation of the translation of ribosomal mRNA (Pellizzoni (1998) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9710533).
Y RNAs	YRNA, RNY RNAs, hY RNA (human)	Conservation	A single cluster of functional Y RNA genes is preserved throughout tetrapod evolution, which however exhibits clade-specific tandem duplications, gene-losses, and rearrangements (Mosig (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18087752).. Homologues of functional Y RNAs are present throughout vertebrates, with conserved synteny, but numbers vary between species, with individual gene-loss events having occurred during evolution in most classes (the mouse expresses only Y1 and Y3 RNAs, zebrafish only Y1, and chicken Y3 and Y4). No Y RNA gene has been identified in some species such as Drosophila melanogaster and Schistosoma species. (Copeland (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19814823, Pruijn (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7505620, Mosig (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18087752, Gardiner (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19474146, O'Brien (1993) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7688474, Perreault (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17470436, Farris (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7534247). Y3 is the most conserved Ro RNA, not only by its more consistent presence in other species, but also at the levels of sequence divergence and secondary structure similarity (Farris (1995) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7534247). . Recently, the 'sbRNAs' or stem-bulge RNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans have been identified as homologs of vertebrate Y RNAs present in nematode worms, showing the characteristic Ro protein binding motif (Boria (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20349053).. An Y-like RNA (as well as other small RNAs) has been also identified in the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans binding to an ortholog of Ro60 (Rsr), which accumulate following UV irradiation, and contribute to the resistance to irradiation (Chen (2000) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10766734).
Y RNAs	YRNA, RNY RNAs, hY RNA (human)	Misc	Thousands of Y RNA 'retropseudogenes' are present among various species (Perreault (2007) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17470436). It has been suggested that hY RNAs represent a novel class of nonautonomous, L1-dependent, retrotransposable elements (Perreault (2005) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15817567).
Zeb2NAT	ZEB2AS	Characteristics	>1.2 kb; antisense to Zeb2 (a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin) (Nelles (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13679026).
Zeb2NAT	ZEB2AS	Expression	Expression is upregulated by Snail1 (Beltran (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347095).
Zeb2NAT	ZEB2AS	Function	Controls translation and therefore function of the Zeb2 protein coding gene through regulation of Zeb2 mRNA splicing (Beltran (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347095).. Zeb2 translation requires retention of an intron, Zeb2NAT overlaps the 5' splicing site of this intron and when expressed inhibits splicing allowing translation of Zeb2 (Beltran (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347095).. Snail1 acts to stimulate Zeb2 synthesis via post-transcriptional regulation which appears to be mediated by Zeb2NAT (Beltran (2008) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347095).
Zeb2NAT	ZEB2AS	Conservation	Good conservation between human and mouse (Nelles (2003) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13679026).
Zeb2NAT	ZEB2AS	Name	Zeb2NAT: Zeb2 natural antisense transcript
Zfas1	Znfx1 antisense, 1500012F01Rik, NCRNA00275	Characteristics	Expressed from a bi-directional promoter with the protein-coding gene Znfx1. Zfas1 5â is antisense to 5â of Znfx1.. Spliced, polyadenylated. . SnoRNA host gene, contains 3 intronic C/D box snoRNAs.. Human orthologue is alternatively spliced. 
Zfas1	Znfx1 antisense, 1500012F01Rik, NCRNA00275	Expression	Highly expressed and differentially expressed during mammary development. Strongly down-regulated during lactation compared to pregnancy and then up-regulated again during involution. Znfx1 coding gene,in contrast, was more lowly expressed and was not differentially expressed during mammary gland development.. Expressed in the epithelial cells of the mammary gland ducts and alveoli.. Zfas1 is widely expressed in mouse tissues including brain, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, heart and embryo, showing higher expression than Znfx1.. Zfas1 extremely stable with a half life of >32 hrs in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells. Compared to a half life of 50 minutes for Znfx1. The increased stability of Zfas1 may explain why its expression level is much higher than Znfx1. However, in mouse 3T3 and embryonic stem cells Zfas1 stability was much lower with a half-life of 1.7 hr and 63 min respectively, while the human ZFAS1 had a half-life of 3 hr in B-cells (Friedel (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561200, Sharova (2009) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19001483, Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755). These results suggest there is significant regulation of Zfas1 stability both within and between species (Clark (2012) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755).. Localised to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. . Human ZFAS1 expression is reduced in ductal carinoma compared to normal tissue.
Zfas1	Znfx1 antisense, 1500012F01Rik, NCRNA00275	Function	Zfas1 appears to have a role in mammary gland proliferation and differentiation.. - Zfas1 knockdown in a HC11 cell culture model of mammary differentiation showed increased differentiation and a probable increase in proliferation. Knockdown had little effect on intronic snoRNA expression suggesting the Zfas1 host transcript is functional.. - Zfas1 knockdown appears to affect Znfx1 expression.
Zfas1	Znfx1 antisense, 1500012F01Rik, NCRNA00275	Conservation	Syntenic transcription observed in multiple mammals.. Low conservation of Zfas1 sequence between human and mouse compared to snoRNAs, but Zfas1 has potential secondary structural similarities.
Zfas1	Znfx1 antisense, 1500012F01Rik, NCRNA00275	Name	Zinc finger antisense 1
Zfhx2as	Zfh-5AS	Characteristics	Antisense transcription begins 6-10kb downstream of the Zfhx2 polyA site and ends in first exon of Zfhx2.. Alternatively spliced. Multiple start sites.. Estimated as up to ~30 kb in length.
Zfhx2as	Zfh-5AS	Expression	Expressed in a number of specific regions in the developing mouse brain including the rostral migratory stream (RMS). . Antisense RNA was expressed in a complementary manner to the sense coding sequence. For example the antisense RNA was expressed initially in hippocampal development, with the sense RNA only starting to be expressed when antisense transcription declined. Or, alternatively in the dorsal forebrain where sense and antisense transcripts are expressed in different layers of cells at the same stage.. Expression was highest in mid-gestation E13.5-E16.5.. Adult expression specific to brain, with expression in areas of adult neurogenesis.
Zfhx2as	Zfh-5AS	Function	Zfhx2as negatively regulates the expression of Zfhx2.. Knockout of antisense RNA lead to up-regulation of Zfhx2 expression, with coding gene expression in areas previously showing only expression of the antisense transcript. The same effect was seen in a mutant where Zfhx2 and Zfhx2as no longer overlapped strongly suggesting Zfhx2as negatively regulates Zfhx2.
Zfhx2as	Zfh-5AS	Conservation	Identified in rodents and humans.
Zfhx2as	Zfh-5AS	Misc	NCBI Gene and Refseq sequence given for Zfhx2as (provided here) is only a partial sequence from the center of the antisense transcript. . Since full length transcript not defined, UCSC browser links are best estimates of transcripts. Mouse transcript comes from a Scripture transcript defined by Guttman (2010) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20436462.
Zfhx2as	Zfh-5AS	Name	Zfhx2as: zinc finger homeobox 2, antisense
